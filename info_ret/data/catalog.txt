AMST 111 Power and Identity
This course revolves around the theme of power. This course considers how oppressive structures establish and sustain themselves -- and face opposition -- at local national and international levels. We will begin by addressing the question how does opposition imply alternative forms of power visions of freedom self-identification and belonging? Using historical literary theoretical and social perspectives we will focus on the tensions between power's oppressive and liberatory tendencies. For example we will examine famous African American intellectual W.E.B. Du Bois's sole published biography John Brown; test historical case studies through academic inquiries into British and Japanese imperialism; and take an intersectional approach to understanding identity power and domination. Throughout students will build and develop their critical and interpretative skills through reading writing debate and presentation. This course is taught by Professor Jaclyn Rodriguez (Psychology) Professor James Ford (English) and Professor Paul Nam (History).

AMST 240 African American Women Writers
In the 1970s African­American women writers dominated the literary market. The novels and memoirs of Toni Morrison, Maya Angelou, and Alice Walker were read and praised widely. Though the 1970s saw a surge in their popularity, African-American women had been writing since the nation's inception, as exemplified by Phillis Wheatley's 1773 volume of poems. Throughout its literary history, African­American women's writing has reflected upon and often challenged assumptions about American identity and experience, racial justice, and gender and sexual norms. This course surveys the long history of this literature and focuses especially on texts that supply world views inflected by the particular experience of living as American, black, and female. Authors under consideration include those mentioned above as well as June Jordan, Audre Lorde, Toni Cade Bambara, Sojourner Truth, Sonia Sanchez, Octavia Butler, and Evie Shockley.

Emphasis will be placed on films that express innovation and experimentation. We will trace the evolution (and occasion devolution) of cinematic themes such as the representation of slavery, the depiction of black interiority, representations of gender and sexuality, and the portrayal of race itself. Films we might study include Selma, Fruitvale Station, Daughters of the Dust, Lemonade, Pariah, Bush Mama, Do the Right Thing, and An Oversimplification of Her Beauty.

Black Literary History and the Archive:
Black Literary History and the Archive Description: How do we resurrect the lives of people who were considered unimportant those whose contributions were dismissed and buried? What does the existing historical archive tell us about what is considered valuable and about what constitutes "memory"? This class examines the lives of two of the most important nineteenth-century Black women writers Harriet Jacobs and Harriet Wilson as a means to develop the tools of literary recovery. As we expand the contours of the historical canon we will also reflect on our own sense of the scope and shape of African American historical memory and the ways in which we organize history. How do we interpret religion resistance and labor activities that that fall "outside" of the most recognized narratives about African American experience? This class will take on these larger questions as we also engage in archival work in newspapers census records and beyond.

AMST 346 Beautiful Democracy: 19th Century African American Literature
This course thinks through current debates over the relationship between literary aesthetics and harmony in American democracy. Do aesthetics foster a more harmonious or disharmonious national culture? Do aesthetics create more peaceful cities and craft a common culture? Should its subject matter be legal resolutions to conflict and representations of peaceful communities? Or is disharmony ever important to progress? How does literature represent protests for social change that are often only possible outside the law like the many freedmen and freedwomen escaping slavery and demanding the destruction of that system? How does this alter our understandings of what it means to be "fugitive"? How can the fugitive fighting for freedom be distinguished from the unprincipled outlaw? From another perspective we will consider how the complications of American society have altered certain traditional literary forms. While recent scholarship has addressed these questions in regards to early to mid 20th century literature this course will look back further starting from the early 19th century to the very beginning of the 20th. will complement the literature by reading relevant historical materials from the abolitionist movement labor movements government debates over Emancipation and Reconstruction etc. The course will include literature from Frederick Douglass Sojourner Truth Walt Whitman Ida B Wells and Charles Chesnutt among others and will cover several genres including oratory autobiography political pamphlets and short fiction.

ARTH 287 History of Photography
What is a photograph? Is it a "document" or a "work of art?" Who makes a photograph and for whom does s/he make it? How and where do photographs circulate? What effect does the context in which a photograph is viewed have on its meaning(s)? Designed as a selective history of photography in the 19th and 20th centuries this course revolves around questions like these (although these are not the only issues we will explore) regarding the nature and function of photography in modern culture. Through thematic lectures a wide-ranging list of readings and in-class discussion we will explore the medium from multiple perspectives. Students will develop the critical skills they need to read and critically analyze the visual rhetoric that shapes photographic representations. In addition to learning about the different photographic genres - exploration and travel photography; studio and portrait work; medical and legal documentation; fine art prints; photojournalism - this class will push students to investigate photography's position within a broader cultural field: the medium's shifting relations to the artistic avant-gardes; advertising and consumer culture; constructions of race gender and national identity; and photography's role in producing history itself. Readings will include primary source materials and theories of photographic meaning; students will be asked to grasp not only the medium's technological and rhetorical functions but also to develop their own critical perspectives on photography's shifting relations to intellectual social and political ideologies. Coursework will require one hands-on photographic project and a museum visit.

History of Green Architecture:
This course will pursue and ultimately aim to reconcile two separate questions about sustainability and architecture. To begin with what makes a particular building -- house office block or skyscraper -- green? Second and more fundamentally how has our understanding of the relationship between architecture and nature shifted over the centuries? The course will begin by looking at a range of depictions of that relationship in art architecture literature and philosophy before moving on to examine architecture's role in the nascent environmental movement of the 1960s and 1970s. It will consider the rise and increasing codification of green architecture in the last 15 years in the U.S. and Europe isolating certain buildings as case studies and assessing in some depth recent debates over the American green-design rating system known as LEED. Finally we'll ask what green architects might learn from the ways that other sustainability movements -- in transportation product design clean-energy and food policy -- have matured over the years. Students will visit a number of built examples of green architecture in and around Los Angeles. No prior study of architectural history is required.
Art and Crime: Plunder Fakes and Forensics:

Art Crime has received increasing attention over the past decade especially in Southern California. Los Angeles Museums (The Getty Bowers and Norton Simon) Museums dealers and collectors all face increased scrutiny as an ongoing series of scandals highlight weak points in our authentication systems. Forensic science and technical art history have helped address these important issues in art history and material culture. This course encompasses issues such as how are forgers unmasked how is plunder sourced and when should it be returned? These questions often lead to larger discussions on the limits of expertise and science the nature of authenticity what is valuable and why and who owns the past-that bring together art and science material culture and sustainability.

ARTH 395 Special Topics in Art History
Who Owns Art?
As art objects--especially those from antiquity--have become increasingly valuable as both commodities and as national treasures the question of who owns art and who is best to care for them is essential to museum curators academics and politicians. There are several debates over who owns art of ancient civilizations like Greece and India. Do treasures like the Parthenon sculptures at the British Museum belong to Greece and should they be returned? Or should they remain in the museum where more people have access to them? This seminar will introduce students to laws enacted by UNESCO (United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization) to protect world cultural and national heritage as well as examine museum collecting policies in America.

ARTS 280 Transdisciplinary Studio: College and the Art Center
General Course Description: A Team-Taught course pairing an College and an Art Center College of Design Faculty member in project-based work integrating the history theory and practice of the visual arts. Topic for Spring 2016: Maker Communities: From Arts and Crafts to DIY along the Arroyo Seco. In the early twentieth century a cultural blossoming that came to be known as the "Arroyo Culture" emerged along the Arroyo Seco river from the Hahamong'na Watershed above Pasadena through Eagle Rock Highland Park and the diverse communities of Northeast Los Angeles down to the Confluence with the LA River in Cypress Park. This Arroyo Culture sprung from the international Arts and Crafts Movement's emphasis on the handmade seeking to fuse the material and the spiritual and thereby make everyday objects and architecture the expression of individuality and artistic purpose. This course a collaboration between College College and the Art Center College of Design will trace this rich and innovative Arroyo Culture through the community's many demographic and cultural transformations and particularly the revolutionary reinvention of the tradition by Latino artists and intellectuals up through today's resurgent "maker" culture. In the process students from the two institutions will engage with both the rich cultural and geographical history of the area and the work of present day designers and artists. That engagement will culminate in a final project and presentation reflecting (either at students' individual option through research-driven writing or in physical form through a work of art/design) the cultural production flourishing along the watershed of the Arroyo Seco.

ARTS 290 Art Outside the Bounds: Wanlass Artists in Residence
Thematic Focus for Fall 2015: "Power Play." This course taught by the 2015/16 Wanlass Artists in Residence CamLab will examine the power dynamics of the way individuals come together in groups. Through making and using relational objects (a term coined in the 1960s by Brazilian artist Lygia Clark) we will experiment with how individuals can maintain their agency when scaling up from relationships with ourselves to large public groups. A relational object is used by participants in service of an experience beyond the immediate materiality of the object this can be a solo collaborative or communal experience. For reference we'll look at the organizational strategies of movements such as 1970s feminist consciousness-raising sessions 21st century horizontalism and free schools. Students should be prepared to develop the following skills: critical thinking and speaking basic hands-on making and compassionate self-reflexivity. All those with an interest in contemporary art psychology social justice activist history transformation and organizing are encouraged to register.

ARTS 301 Writing Art and Writing As Art
Audre Lorde famously wrote that the master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s house. What possibilities open up when we use language - a common currency of our everyday lives, too often the foundation that props up structures of confinement and limitation—on our own terms, in forms of our own invention and modes we imagine autonomously? How can we use writing to support and expand the work we do as artists? Is language a “master’s tool” or is it a tool we can use to “dismantle the master’s house”? In this class, we will explore creative forms such as artistic manifestos, statements of poetics/aesthetics, and reviews as invitations to better understand and articulate the parameters of our own art practice, and as powerful opportunities for collective enunciation. We will do close readings of primary texts from European, Latin American, and USAmerican avant-garde and art-activist movements, both historical and present-day. We will consider essays, reviews, manifestos, poems, blog posts, and tweets. Students will write individual and collaborative art statements as a way to clarify their own work, and think through larger issues in aesthetics and the social/political potential of art. Assignment exercises will encompass research and practice in collective and individual art writing, focusing both on our own work and on the work of other artists.

CSLC 109 From Kafka to Twitter: Small Forms of the Literary
Small forms cover the broad field from aphorisms, epigrams, fables and riddles to anecdotes, jokes, short stories and novellas. In each of these forms, smallness unfolds in different and historically-specific ways. From the aphorisms of the 19th century to the Twitter updates of today, the course will explore the poetics and pragmatics of small forms in German literature, philosophy, and contemporary social media. Questions to be discussed in the course include: What can small mean at the level of (literary) form? What kind of readings does small form facilitate? Which does it thwart? To what extent does small form gain epistemological significance with respect to the critique of systematic philosophy? And what can its contemporary manifestation in the form of social media “microformats” such as tweets, blog posts, and Vine videos inform us about condensation, narration and knowledge in the present? Readings include Georg Lichtenberg, Schlegel, Novalis, Nietzsche, Kafka, Walser, Benjamin and Twitter. All readings and discussion in English.

CSLC 120 Metamorphic Bodies: Fluid Forms from Ovid to Kafka
"To speak of forms changed into new bodies [...] from the very beginning of the world up to my own times." Thus begins Ovid's Metamorphoses, whose programmatic opening stanza links the the birth of the world from formlessness and chaos to a narrative principle of transformation and change over time. This course will explore the shifting conceptions of metamorphosis -- the transformation of "forms [...] into new bodies," and vice versa -- from its mythic origins in Ovid to its modern manifestations and modulations in the works of Goethe, Darwin, and Kafka. Throughout the course, we will examine the ambiguous relationship between "forms" and "bodies" in Western thought and how the permutations of this nexus come to bear on a wide variety of different topics in the humanities, including myths and theories of changing forms in nature (plants, clouds, animals); dynamic representations of gender, sexuality, and erotics; as well as figures of hybridity and the grotesque (human-animal hybrids, beasts, and monstrosities). More broadly, the course will explore the porous interfaces between ancient and modern poetics, myth and modernity, as well as the arts and sciences.

CSLC 182 Love's Song: A Poetic-Philosophic History
In this course we will trace one historic trajectory of what we today call "love," from Ancient Greece to the Renaissance, and shall do so through a careful examination of the literature that sought to give expression to this ever-changeable and always-provocative concept: the songs of Sappho, the dialogues of Plato, the erotic manuals of Ovid, the Gospels of Christianity, the troubled Confessions of Augustine, the courtly tales of knights in the Middle Ages, and the great all-encompassing journey of Dante through heaven, hell and purgatory in the Divine Comedy. Significant attention will be paid to the way each of these works continues to contribute to our own modern expressions and notions of love, in all their ecstatic, heartbreaking, inspiring and frustrating complexity.

CSLC 200 Literature, Culture, Self: Being in the Wor(l)d
Drawing upon literatures and language traditions from across the world the immediate object of this course will be to help students develop a lively appreciation for and analytic facility with each of the major kinds of literary production (lyric narrative and drama) all of which we shall try to examine in their “traditional” as well as in some of their more familiar contemporary forms (not only the lyric poem and the prose novel but the popular song the graphic novel and the television series too will fall within the special compass of our inquiry). Beyond these immediate goals of familiarity and competence however the wider ambition of this course will be to develop students’ understanding of the crucial role that literary (and literature-based) forms play in the constitution of the cultures we inhabit and the various "subject-positions" we might occupy within them . To this end we shall make ourselves familiar with some of the most important thinkers in recent literary and cultural theory (Foucault Derrida Kristeva Sianne Ngai to name but a few). Given the course’s broad international range guest lecturers will be brought in throughout the semester to discuss the effect of reading works in the original language and to explore more generally the effect that the specific features of a language can exert over that delicate interplay of “literature culture and self” that forms the central subject matter of this class. This course serves as the Proseminar for CSLC and is required for the major but is open to all students.

CSLC 225 Probing the Limits of Representation: The Holocaust in Literature and Film
Probing the Limits of Representation: The Holocaust in Literature and Film The Holocaust has been positioned at the limits of representation -- as the indescribable, the incomprehensible. The impossibility of adequately expressing the atrocities of the Holocaust stands in contrast to the need to transmit knowledge about this event to later generations. Attempts to represent the Holocaust, to describe and understand this event and its implications, are numerous and have occurred across a wide range of media forms (literature, film, photography, art, music, monuments, etc.), and genres (as in documentary, drama, comedy, science fiction). As the Holocaust recedes in time and the numbers of living historical witnesses and survivors decline, these representations increasingly shape our perception and understanding of the event. This course will investigate literary, filmic, and artistic representations of the Holocaust, focusing in particular on questions of ethics, aesthetics and history.

CSLC 226 Terrorism and Film: Bonnie and Clyde in Germany
We will outline the historical background of the Baader-Meinhof-Gang, a violent, leftist collective with roots in the revolutionary student movement that swept Germany in the 1960s. The group’s assassinations, kidnappings and bombings of the German establishment left a legacy of terror – a legacy that has been argued over ever since. The literature and films about the Baader-Meinhof Gang, which illustrate the crushing effect of National Socialism on the ‘68 generation as well as their rebellion against the excesses of the capitalist consumer paradise, are controversial. Many have condemned the movies for its exciting, Bonnie-and-Clyde depiction of the gang members what gives particular the group’s leaders cult status. We will discuss why German filmmakers tend to heroize a group that has terrorized a country for decades and analyze what effect this has on German collective memory.

In this course we shall attempt to come to terms with three of the most important--and provocative--philosophers of the last two hundred years philosophers without whom the great majority of contemporary literary and cultural theory (and much art and literature itself) would essentially be unthinkable. Significantly all three of these philosophers habitually turned to ancient Greek tragedy in the formulation articulation and further elaboration of their thought. In this class we shall therefore attempt to use the experience of Greek tragedy in all its ecstatic strangeness as a powerful point of entry into the difficult yet crucial works these philosophers have bequeathed to us. Major texts to be covered include: the plays of Aeschylus and Sophocles The Phenomenology of Spirit The Birth of Tragedy Thus Spoke Zarathustra Being and Time and Introduction to Metaphysics.

CSLC 281 From Rom-Com to Sci-Fi: Hellenistic Literature (and You )
Though we often tend to think of our Greek cultural inheritance as coming exclusively from Classical Athens, it was in fact the Hellenistic Greeks--those peoples and empires arising after the fall of Athens, in the wake of the conquests of Alexander the Great-- who gave world literature many of its most enduring, familiar and (contemporarily relevant) genres: romantic comedy, travel literature, science fiction, biography, the pastoral, and the self-help manual--to name only the most obvious. Our task in this course will be to try to understand why this vast array of literary types came to matter so much to the Greek-speaking empires of long ago, and why they still seem to matter so much to us today.

Neo-Nazism is not an exclusively German phenomenon though - we find similar developments in other European countries in Canada and in the US. This course will track the activities of Neo-Nazis in Germany from 1990 to the present. We will analyze the impact of unification on the growth of right wing militancy throughout Germany and examine examples of Neo-Nazi and skinhead activities as well as the efforts of various governments to control this movement. A key question will be why exactly young people between 15 and 30 are drawn to these groups who often use and develop sophisticated networks. Finally the question will be asked what the most effective means of combating these movements would or should be.

Finally we will explore the ways in which these written filmic and artistic cultural artifacts have attempted to narrate the events of the Holocaust and examine exemplary responses to the Shoah in a variety of media forms and genres. The course will deal with questions of ethics and aesthetics such as the meaning of art and the limits of historical representation. What are the aesthetic and ethical implications of creating art about the Holocaust? Does all representation entail an aestheticization of horror?

In its wake the "weaker" economies mostly at the periphery were more affected than the stronger ones. But there also other problems such as the lack of democratic structures as well as strong leadership the weight of a centralized bureaucracy and the lack of a European public sphere.

Some of his great early works such as the "Three Penny Opera" will be seen in the context of the time especially the very turbulent last years of the Weimar Republic before Hitler's rise to power. We will also look at Brecht's legendary film "Kuhle Wampe" and visit at least one contemporary production of a Brecht play staged at a theatre in Los Angeles.
Bertolt Brecht: The Great Plays:
Brecht's great plays changed the stage of world theatre. In order to understand and appreciate their powerful and long lasting influence all major plays written during Brecht's exile i.e. in the years between 1933 when he was driven out of Germany and 1948 when he returned to Switzerland and ultimately Berlin will be discussed. Aside from detailed analyses of plays such as "Mother Courage" "The Good Woman of Sezuan" "The Caucasian Chalk Circle" or "Life of Galilei" Brecht's developing theory of epic theatre and the general conditions and dilemmas of exile will be discussed. We will also look at Brecht's role in Hollywood his collaboration on the film "Hangmen Also Die" and his successful attempts to direct his own plays on German and European stages after 1950. Students minoring in German or majoring in Group Languages or IPS will read most of the texts in the original. Prerequisite for German minor and Group Language majors: GERM 202 or GERM 232. Open to all other non-first year students. The course is taught in English no knowledge of German is required.
Memory Trauma and Victim Culture:
This course is concerned with the cultural politics of memory and trauma after the catastrophic events of the Holocaust and World War II. We will start with basic questions such as: Whose memories are sought and commemorated in the public sphere? What problems do traumatic events present for those attempting to represent them? Is trauma a useful cultural concept? What are the differences between individual and collective memory? The first part of the course analyzes memory and trauma on both the individual level and the collective level and turns then to the specific processes that occur when traumatic events are remembered by survivors as well as the collective processes involved when memories of traumatic events such as the Holocaust are shared with an audience who has no first-hand experience of them.- The second part of the course aims to identify the recent fascination especially in European and American culture with the phenomenon of trauma suffering and victimhood. We will study the cultural politics of trauma and memory in relation to two events - the Holocaust and German suffering during World War II. The unit "Holocaust victimhood and American-Jewish identity" explores how the kitsch nature of popular culture representations of the Holocaust (from the Anne Frank movie of to the very successful TV-series Holocaust to the Hollywood movie Schindler's List) created the paradigm for trauma culture at large. The unit "Germans in collective memory between perpetrators and victims" discusses contemporary German memory discourse which primarily focuses on the experience of German suffering as a consequence of the war and the Third Reich. However to recast Germans as victim is highly problematic since the position of victim is already occupied by those people who were persecuted and murdered by the Germans/Nazis. Memory trauma and victimhood are crucial aspects of the experiences of Jews and Germans after 1945. A systematic exploration of these aspects (as manifested in a broad variety of cultural forms) promises important insights into recent history and culture.
Nazi Culture:
After the Nazis came to power in 1933 they took over control of all aspects of German life. One of the first tasks the new government undertook upon their ascension to power was a synchronization of all professional and social organizations with Nazi ideology and policy. Joseph Goebbels Nazi Minister for Popular Enlightenment and Propaganda began an effort to bring German arts and culture in line with Nazi goals. The government purged cultural organizations of Jewish and other officials alleged to be politically suspect or who performed or created art works which Nazi ideologues labeled "degenerate." Some 650 works by such renowned artists as Max Beckmann Marc Chagall Otto Dix Wassily Kandinsky and Paul Klee were declared "degenerate art" and removed from German museums. The Nazi "cultivation of art" also extended to the modern field of cinema theater music architecture youth education and even to the lower levels of popular culture. Throughout the duration of the Nazi regime 'culture' in all its manifestations played a crucial role. Political rallies military parades sports events open air festivals and other skillfully organized events were used from the beginning to suggest a "national awakening" and the "revolutionary spirit" of the new regime. The efforts of the Nazis to regulate German culture corresponded to what historian George Mosse calls an effort "toward a total culture" i.e. an effort to influence at the most basic level the lives and actions of all Germans. This course will explore the various forms of culture during this time and will raise the question to what extent 'Nazi culture' or culture under Nazi domination was capable of stabilizing the regime until its very end in 1945. German minors and group language majors have to complete either GERM 202 or GERM 232 since they will read some of the material in German.
Marx Freud and the Frankfurt School:
This seminar will explore the origins of the world famous Frankfurt School a group of German social philosophers and theoreticians which emerged at the Institute for Social research of the University of Frankfurt am Main in the 1920s who wanted a) to analyze the conditions of modern capitalism and its impact on society in general on family and social structures value systems and mass culture b) critically review the theories of Karl Marx Sigmund Freud and Max Weber and c) to establish the principles and foundations of a 'critical theory.' We'll read and discuss major works by Max Horkheimer Theodor W. Adorno Walter Benjamin Herbert Marcuse Erich Fromm Siegfried Kracauer Leo Loewenthal and others. The seminar will focus on the 'first phase' of the Frankfurt School its beginnings and its work and development during the thirties and forties - when the school relocated to New York and many of its collaborators lived in other American cities or abroad - and the immediate post WWII period. (A second seminar will follow next year and explore the school's development and its world wide impact in the sixties and seventies.) The course is taught in English. Students minoring or majoring in German will read some of the original texts (especially Marx Freud Benjamin and Kracauer) in German. Same as CTSJ 370.
The Frankfurt School 1945 to the Present:
Social Analysis Cultural Theory and Political Action. This seminar will explore the history of the Frankfurt School after World War II when it was re-established in Frankfurt and began to play a crucial role in the development of a 'critical theory' of society and culture during the West German 'economical miracle;' afterwards with the onset of the German (and international) student movement of the mid-Sixties it gained international reputation and impacted social political and cultural discourses in countries like France Great Britain Italy or the United States. We will study primarily some of the major writings of Th. W. Adorno (especially on art music cultural theory and the lessons of Fascism) H. Marcuse (whose writings on social theory and aesthetics on 'repressive tolerance' and 'liberation' exerted a strong influence on the student movement) and of J. Habermas who became one of the most influential European intellectuals in the decades after 1970. This seminar is the continuation of an earlier class on the beginnings of the Frankfurt School and its history until 1945; participation in that earlier seminar is not required. The course is taught in English. Students minoring in German or majoring in Group Language or IPS will read some of the original texts in German.

GRK 380 Hegel Nietzsche Heidegger: Tragic Philosophy
This course will meet at the same time as CSLC 280 and for an additional weekly meeting in which we shall translate one tragedy by Sophocles one by Aeschylus from the original Greek. Description for CSLC 280 follows: In this course we shall attempt to come to terms with three of the most important--and provocative--philosophers of the last two hundred years philosophers without whom the great majority of contemporary literary and cultural theory (and much art and literature itself) would essentially be unthinkable. Significantly all three of these philosophers habitually turned to ancient Greek tragedy in the formulation articulation and further elaboration of their thought. In this class we shall therefore attempt to use the experience of Greek tragedy in all its ecstatic strangeness as a powerful point of entry into the difficult yet crucial works these philosophers have bequeathed to us. Major texts to be covered include: the plays of Aeschylus and Sophocles The Phenomenology of Spirit The Birth of Tragedy Thus Spoke Zarathustra Being and Time and Introduction to Metaphysics.

CSP 2 From Oceania to Los Angeles
Many “off-island” Pacific Islanders have made Los Angeles their home. Pacific Islander festivals, artists, museum exhibitions, and civic organizations have contributed to the urban fabric of the city. This course will engage with scholarship about indigeneity and diaspora in order to think about the ways in which Oceanic art and culture shapes the Los Angeles landscape. Alongside this urban narrative of space and cultural contact, we will also consider Hollywood’s role in the fabrication of island(er) identity in the media. We will discuss and analyze the intersection and disjuncture between diaspora and representation after screenings of Bird of Paradise (1932), South Pacific (1958), Hawaii Five-O (1968/2010), The Descendants (2011), and Disney’s Moana (2016).

CSP 3 Human Rights in Latin America in Literature and Film
Until not long ago, Latin America was best known for its economic, social, and political turbulence. With most of the region in the hands of authoritarian governments, human rights violations were widespread and ranged from a lack of free elections to "disappearances" and state-sponsored genocidal violence. Today the region is, to varying degrees, almost all democratic.  While problems such as poverty, organized crime and violence against women still take a toll on individual rights, the region should not just be known for its problems.  Argentina's post-dictatorship experience has become a model in transitional justice studied around the world, and gay marriage has made surprising headway.  Today there are many resources available for the promotion and protection of human rights in Latin America -- from national legislation promoted by local activists, to treaties and a regional court. While focusing on political, social and legal developments rather than on literary analysis, this class relies substantially on short stories, a play, testimonial essays and films to explore human rights-related problems and progress in Latin America over the last 60 years.

CSP 4 "To Be Continued...": The Serial Impulse in Literature and Other Media
Ever since the emergence of serialized formats of fiction in the 19th century, the phrase “to be continued” has left readers in a state of suspense. Eager to keep reading along at home, they now had to impatiently wait for the next installment in order to continue. This course will examine the aesthetics and practices of seriality from the mid-19th century to the present. We will consider how the concept of seriality, as a common logic underlying mass media production, and the series as a distinct form of open-ended composition, articulate themselves in different historical periods across different media (literature, art, television, film), in works ranging from the "mass productions" of popular culture to the artistic experiments of the avant-garde. Course material includes Goethe, Poe, Dickens, Kafka, Benjamin, Deleuze, Warhol, Eco, “The Perils of Pauline” (1914), and “Twin Peaks” (1990-91).

CSP 5 Science and You
Who should you believe:  the sculpted Adonis who attributes his heavenly body solely to Product A, or your middle-aged doctor as he looks over horn-rimmed glasses and preaches to you his mantra of fruits and vegetables?  This course will explore how science is portrayed to the public, with the aim of deconstructing issues to objectively evaluate the merits of the arguments.  The first part of the course will explore in great depth the perpetual, self-corrective process of the scientific method to demonstrate the necessity of research and contradictory viewpoints.  The focus will then shift towards topics that include, among others, health/fitness, biotech, and the environment.
Be prepared:
This course includes a rigorous writing component, requires intensive group work both within the classroom (e.g., presentations) and beyond (e.g., community engagement), and emphasizes development of oral presentation skills.
Students enrolling in this course must have a solid background in high school chemistry and biology.

CSP 6 Making it New: Modernity, Modernism, and the Avant-Garde
During the first half of the 20th century—a time of great social, political, and technological change—many writers, artists, and musicians sought new and innovative modes of expression. While their works varied in both genre and style, modernists shared a common desire, in the words of the poet Ezra Pound, to “make it new.” Focusing on the period from 1870 to 1970, this interdisciplinary course will examine the history of a tumultuous century through an exploration of the radically new forms of literature, art, and music it produced. How did writers, artists, and musicians deal with issues of race, gender, and sexuality? How did they react to brutal wars and periods of intense political oppression? And what exactly does it mean to be “avant-garde”? From Wilde to Woolf, Kandinsky to O’Keeffe, Stravinsky to Sgt. Pepper, this course will examine what it means to create modern works for a modern world. Open only to first year frosh.

How is identity represented in visual culture?  This course looks at motion pictures, print media, and art, and asks who gets represented and how? We focus on the depiction of race, gender, sexuality, and nation in the late-20th century/early 21st century to uncover how larger ideas about individual and communal identities are produced and circulated. Students will learn how to identify and negotiate the multiple interpretations elicited by an object of study and to make a compelling argument for a particular reading. We will explore numerous methodologies—including art history, cultural studies, film analysis, gender studies, race criticism, and more—and apply these in our critical writing.

CSP 8 Asian Student Movement
Some have discounted the youth of our society as apathetic and trivial, becoming further distanced from society at large and ever more self-absorbed in their own cyberworlds of social media and networking. In the recent past, however, the strength and ideologies of youth toppled governments and changed the world. The focus of this course will be on examining and analyzing pivotal historical student movements in Asia: the Anpo movements in 1960s Japan, the democratization movement of the 1980s in Korea, and finally 1989’s Tiananmen Demonstrations in China. Points of comparison are the student movements in 1960s America and the most recent Occupy movements.

CSP 11 Spectacle and the Stage in Ancient Rome
The ancient Romans had a flair for the dramatic, creating spaces and staging performances which matched the grandness of their empire. Gladiatorial games, theatrical productions, chariot races, and other festivals played an integral role in the civic, religious, and cultural life of the ancient Romans.

CSP 12 Literature And Philosophy: Dionysus In Modern Thought
More than simply a “god of wine,” Dionysus was for the Ancient Greeks a god of ecstatic self-abandon, of gushing fertility, of violent dismemberment and unexpected rebirth. In myth he was attended by crazed Maenads and mischievous Satyrs; amongst humans he was worshipped with festive dances, communal shouts, ritual obscenities, and (perhaps most importantly) with poetry—with the literary genres of ode, comedy and tragedy that were invented specifically to honor him.  What could be farther, we might ask, from the cool, reasonable practice of philosophy than this wild, uncanny, irrational god? And yet, as we shall see in this class, this reckless god of madness and poetry stands at the foundation of some of the most important ideas in modern philosophy—Hegel’s phenomenology of spirit, Nietzsche’s will to power, Heidegger’s philosophy of being.  Beginning with an exploration of Dionysian poetics, this course will attempt to show what Hegel, Nietzsche, Heidegger and others found so inspiring in this ancient god, and what the writers and thinkers of our own time might find in him still.

CSP 13 The Artist's Life
Many students know the typical novel focuses on a single character’s life journey—what literary scholars call the “bildungsroman.” In this class we will examine an understudied subgenre—the künstlerroman or “life of the artist.” We will consider key features of this narrative form and how it alters across literary, film, visual art and musical genres. By framing fugitive slave narratives as “escape artists”; by exploring visual artists like Jean-Michel Basquiat and Kara Walker; by watching Black Swan starring Natalie Portman and Spike Lee’s Bamboozled, we will understand the complexity of taking up the artist’s journey in the modern world and how this path becomes a metaphor for past and present social struggles.

CSP 15 Music and Migration
In recent years scholars of human migration have begun to see music as a rich source of information about migrant communities and cultures. Because migrant communities do not always have access to other forms of communicative media, music can sometimes offer a unique glimpse into the worldviews and immigration histories of those who have voluntarily and involuntarily left their lands of origin. Why do people migrate and how can music help us to understand the varied circumstances that have historically impelled migration? How does music inform migrant’s attitudes about their communities of origin and about their host societies, and articulate the new social locations and economic possibilities that emerge post-migration? How are contemporary patterns of global migration different from early migrations and how can music help us to understand those differences? In this course we will approach music as a lens through which to understand the complex socio-economic circumstances, motivations, and life trajectories of diverse migrant communities.

CSP 17 Equality as a Social Ideal
Although many people and communities claim to value “equality” as a basic principle of justice, what we do and should mean by this ideal is up for debate. In this course, we will explore both historical and contemporary philosophical accounts of the value of equality as a moral ideal, with special attention to economic and social inequality. We will ask: Why should we value equality? Should we value equality for its own sake, or only instrumentally? What kinds of inequities should we care about (i.e. – wealth, resources, opportunities, standing, or something else)? How should a commitment to equality inform our education system and healthcare system?

We will explore three themes in close readings of these texts: 1) nature writing as literary genre, 2) nature writing as development of spiritual consciousness, and 3) nature writing as expression of ecological/environmental concern. Focusing on North America, we will give special attention to California and the West, as we review the connection between nature writing and emergent environmental ethics in a time of environmental crisis. This writing seminar will draw from the skill and power of nature writing to advance our own efforts at effective writing.

CSP 19 Visual Storytelling And Narrative Film
As a first-year seminar, this course is intended to introduce you to the critical thinking and writing that will be expected of you throughout your career at College. Although our study will focus on a single topic—visual storytelling in narrative film—the skills you learn in this course should transmit seamlessly to your other courses. In particular, you should learn to read primary sources (in our case, the films themselves and what the filmmakers say and write about their work) sympathetically and critically. Then you will critically engage with scholarly and other analyses of these sources. The result, after careful reading and deep thinking, will be to assert your own positions regarding the material in interesting, sophisticated, and clear ways both verbally and through writing.
Ideally, you will gain more confidence in your writing abilities, which you can carry with you as you respond to any number of writing situations at College (and beyond). We’ll work together towards developing, shaping, and polishing clear, organized, coherent, detailed and compelling essays, the main form of expression in college writing at all levels.

CSP 20 Writing Los Angeles: Place, Race, Identity
This course will examine the social, historical, and spatial forces that have shaped the formation of Los Angeles as a diverse and multiracial, multiethnic city. We will explore central concepts such as urbanity, diaspora, migration, and racial inequality through critical, cultural, and visual theories. Our course materials will also include nonfiction readings in a range of genres, though much of our consideration of the intersecting structures of race and place will be through representations of LA in literature and film. Writing is central to this course: both in terms of our reading and interpretation of writing about LA and in terms of the writing students will produce—reflective, creative, and expository. This class has required film screenings outside of regular class time and includes a “light” community-based learning component as we explore certain cultural artifacts and spaces in Los Angeles, such as Chinatown or Union Station (in our study of Polanski’s film and Blade Runner), or museum exhibits.

CSP 21 Sunshine and Noir: Los Angeles Cultural Studies
This course will consider how Los Angeles has been represented in a cross section of 20th century literature, film, music and popular culture. We will examine contradictory visions of the metropolis as a land of promise and peril where issues of space, race, and class intersect to create an urban culture in which conflict and cooperation exist in productive tension.  Primary texts in the various media will be supplemented and contextualized by secondary readings in social history and cultural theory. Cultural events in greater Los Angeles may be incorporated if appropriate opportunities come up.

CSP 22 We Have Something in Common: Literary Ideas and Illustrations of Community
Community is something we largely take for granted. It is a notion around which we organize our lives, as we all belong to and participate in various communities—from our neighborhoods, to our interest groups, to our nations—yet, at the same time, it is a notion we often struggle to understand or explain. What is a community, exactly; how and when do we belong to one, and what does such belonging mean to our sense of personal and social self? Literature has long meditated on these questions, from essays on the meaning and nature of community to stories about different communities, and their struggles to articulate and develop their shared sense of purpose. This course will read through a selection of these efforts, with the goal to better understand how different communities come into being, what they aim to accomplish, and how or why they succeed and fail.

CSP 23 Mess: A Conceptual History
Once upon a time, mess was something people ate. (At a particularly hungry juncture in the book of Genesis, for instance, an elder son named Esau sells his birthright to his brother Jacob for a “mess of pottage.”) However, over the course of the nineteenth century, the word mess gradually extended the range of its meanings to include more abstract states of mixture; it enriched, piecemeal, its spiritual resonances and cultural applications. Today our appraisals of messy situations, messy feelings, and messy political processes owe their cogency to the nineteenth century’s formalization of this fine term for formlessness. This seminar tells the story of the concept’s evolution by sampling eight distinct types or episodes of mess: the culinary kind, of course, as well as the semantic effect called ambiguity, the affective fields of impertinence and righteous outrage, architectural motifs of sprawl and waste, the info-fuzz termed white noise, and the strange medleys of free jazz. Course texts include a mock-epic by Joel Barlow titled “The Hasty-Pudding” (1796), Elizabeth Stoddard’s female bildungsroman The Morgesons (1862), Pauline Hopkins’s racial-uplift melodrama Contending Forces (1900), the Watts Towers in South Los Angeles, and Kendrick Lamar’s multi-vocal masterpiece, To Pimp a Butterfly (2015).

CSP 24 Contagion: From Plague Narratives to the Literature of Public Health
In this course we will study representations of infectious disease from the Early Modern period to the present day, using these texts as case studies for some of the most pressing political, philosophical, and aesthetic concerns of our age. Plague narratives are an ideal arena in which to investigate the legal, ethical, and conceptual relationships between individual subjects, bodies, and the “body public,” questions about human nature and the state of nature, and questions about how governments form and what the best types of government are. We’ll also analyze how disease in these texts highlights or complicates contemporary conceptions of “otherness,” and how plague narratives employ different narrative frameworks (providential, rational, existential, etc.). Finally, we’ll consider how these texts metaphorize illness and contagion as a way of thinking about other topics (for example: colonialism, print culture, revolutionary politics, and moral decline)—but we’ll also think carefully about the ethical and aesthetic implications of those metaphors. Readings to include Defoe, Dracula, Camus, Zika, and zombies.

CSP 25 The Urban Environment and Human Health
This class will investigate the urban environmental factors that contribute to poor human health and diseases through technical readings, informed discussions and critical analysis. Writings will effectively communicate research methodologies and outcomes in a non-technical and common language. Through readings and discussions, we will identify specific chemicals in urban pollution that are linked to inflammatory diseases and consider the communities most affected by these pollutants with a focus on California and, specifically, the Los Angeles Basin.

CSP 26 In the Process of Shattering Their Chains: Modern Literatures of Resistance in the US & Middle East
The title of this course comes from Frantz Fanon’s The Wretched of the Earth (1961) in a hopeful overture for the decolonizing world. He says, “The peoples of the Third World are in the process of shattering their chains, and what is extraordinary is that they succeed” (34). During Fanon’s lifetime, there may have been some positive results from decolonization, but was liberation achieved? Fanon also focuses on the fact that “decolonization is truly the creation of new men” (2), but what does all of this mean? Who was the “new man”? the “new woman”? What does emancipation signify to this emerging agent? What happened and happens in the process of global decolonization? Using Fanon’s concepts as the theoretical basis of our class, we will examine the representation of the emerging “new man” in novels and short stories by Native American, African American, Chican@, and Asian American writers as well as in works from Palestine, Egypt, and Iran. We will begin in the mid-twentieth century and work through the present day to understand how literatures of resistance have offered challenges and critiques to the notion of emancipation and to Fanon’s concept of the “new man” while expanding upon and complicating his idea.

CSP 27 Hollywood Representations of Race and Ethnicity
The focus of this course is an investigation of how Hollywood film from the silent era to the start of the 21st century reveals both entrenched and changing American attitudes to race and ethnicity.   We will explore Hollywood presentations of whiteness, passing for white, interracial romance, and gender.  Our goal is to learn the cinematic history and gain literacy about the power of film to create, shape, or break images of the ethnic and raced other in America.

CSP 28 American Indians and the Urban Diaspora
At present, 70% of American Indians live in urban areas such as Los Angeles. This course will investigate the challenges and adaptations native communities face in the urban diaspora and investigate the role religion plays in organizing their urban experience (in addition to providing a background in Native American traditions). Special attention will be given to issues that involve the encounter of traditional life ways with the U.S. state, social justice, and issues of religious freedom.  Course materials—which will include case studies, ethnography, film, and literature—will emphasize native voices.  And the class project will be to research and map American Indian landmarks in Los Angeles

CSP 50 China in a Changing World: From the Opium War to Post-Mao Reforms
This course studies China’s cultural, political and social development in a global setting from the early 19th century to the present. It delves briefly into China’s historical background prior to its opening to the Western world forced by Britain in the Opium War, before exploring the profound changes brought by globalization. Western influences in China, from Christianity to Marxism, will be examined with a focus on key events such as the Taiping Rebellion, Boxer Rebellion, Xinhai Revolution, May 4th Movement, Communist Revolution, and China’s recent rise as a global power. Students will gain a unique perspective from which to understand the consequences and impact of globalization on our rapidly changing world.

CSP 51 Race and Popular Culture
This course uses popular culture as a lens to explore the shifting connotations and political significance of American racial ideologies. Grounding what we call “culture” in political, economic, and social contexts, we will ask: what can an examination of such popular forms as fashion, music, sports, and film reveal about the social construction of race and ethnicity in the United States? Focusing on moments when certain popular fads, cultural practices, political performances or media spectacles became lightning rods for the expression of national anxieties about race and ethnicity, we will examine the ways these episodes reflected and, at times, challenged the prevailing social order. The course will be organized around case studies from the early nineteenth century to the present, including the rise and fall of the African Theater Company in New York, the public responses to heavyweight champions Jack Johnson and Muhammad Ali, the significance of the Los Angeles Zoot Suit Riots, and the hysteria surrounding hip hop in the 1980s.

CSP 52 Animals and Society
What is the role of animals in your life?  How and why do you decide who to nurture and who to eat? This course explores the intimate and changing relationship between human and non-human animals, including an examination of how we conceptualize animals:  as companions, food, workers, representatives of self, and more; the rights - or lack thereof - of animals; our animal industries: factory farming, shelters & rescues, animal workers, entertainment, fighting, races, hunting, medical research, and more; boundaries between human and non-human animals; violence against animals, both individualized and institutionalized; animals as a concept: and the social construction of the difference between human and non-human animals.

CSP 53 Genders
Market researchers claim your generation is more gender fluid and “queer” than previous generations. Despite increased visibility of transgender, trans*, gender queer, non-binary, bi-gender, and agender, identities in popular culture, the US Census uses only two, mutually exclusive, gender categories: male or female. Given current political struggles over access to public restrooms, safety, and healthcare, this course asks, what does it mean to be counted? We'll take a critical, inquiry-based approach to the social construction of gender in its personal, political, and economic contexts. The course is organized as a class-wide research project that involves a reflexive essay about your own gender identity, structured interviews with peers, and the design of a survey that investigates the range of gender identities at College. Through this research process, you will gain experience in analytical writing about different kinds of social data (qualitative and quantitative), be introduced to some basic principles of survey design and data analysis, and critically evaluate the problems and significance of quantifying human identity and experience.

CSP 54 Citizen Science: Crowdsourcing Scientific Discovery
Citizen science, or crowdsourced science, is a collaboration between scientists and members of the general public to collect and provide access to data for scientific research. Recent advances in mobile technology and computing have allowed citizen scientists to make substantial contributions to scientific research at an unprecedented scale. In this course, we will trace the history of public participation in science and explore how these collaborations between professional researchers and the public have impacted scientific research, the scientific community, and public perceptions of science. Over the course of the semester, students will critically evaluate and directly engage in citizen science by participating in a variety of citizen-science projects, analyzing open datasets, and conducting an original research project.

CSP 55 Moderation
Conflicts related to group identity or opinion are all around us. Warring religious groups, segregation in housing, income inequality, as well as policies on climate change, immigration, guns, and marriage are all examples of groups in opposition. This course explores the dynamic nature of group formation and dissolution by focusing on individual beliefs. In particular, we will look at how individuals and social structures adapt in order to achieve moderation in the face of conflict. Drawing upon evidence collected through collaborative projects, you will use sociological, economic, and cognitive theories to pose critical questions about group integrity and personal adaptation. Working with your peers, you will then examine these questions using computer models and produce a final research project. No programming experience is required, but we will introduce tools for simulating social dynamic processes that you will be able to apply to other social and ecological phenomena. By studying what structural forces bind us together, you will come away from the course with a toolkit of quantitative and qualitative strategies to address conflict in new situations.

CSP 56 The Russian Experience
The Russian Experience focuses on the enigma and riddle known as “Rus”, “Russia”, “The Russian Empire”, “The Soviet Union” and “The Russian Federation”. This strange land has been a combination of great extremes: West and East, blinding poverty and dazzling wealth, great talent and shocking brutality. The course focuses on the period of Russia's explosion onto the world stage both politically and artistically, beginning with the reign of Alexander I, the Napoleonic Wars and the Decembrist Revolt, and following the development of Russian society and the Russian/Soviet State through the 19th and 20th Centuries, up to the current post-Soviet Russian Federation. There will be equal emphasis on internal politics, the arts, and international relations.
This is a 4-unit course with two linked seminar sections.

CSP 57 Weimar on the Pacific: German Exile Culture in Los Angeles
After Hitler’s seizure of power in 1933, Los Angeles became an unlikely cultural sanctuary for thousands of German artists and intellectuals who fled the Nazi regime. Many of these German expatriates ultimately settled in the U.S., where – simultaneously attracted and alienated by their new surroundings – they made a significant impact on American culture. During their years in exile, they would produce a substantial body of major works, in which Weimar Germany and its culture – with its mix of 18th-century classicism and 20th-century modernism – served as a key reference point. This seminar will explore German Exile Culture in Los Angeles, spanning film (Fritz Lang, Billy Wilder), architecture (Richard Neutra, Rudolf Schindler), literature (Thomas Mann, Bertolt Brecht, Lion Feuchtwanger), and philosophy (Adorno, Horkheimer). Based on the aesthetic and conceptual specificities of cultural phenomena, class discussions will focus on the relations between art and politics, modernist and mass culture, art and capitalism, culture and democracy.

CSP 58 Art In The Arroyo: Bohemian Cultures Of Northeast Los Angeles
This course will consider a variety of sources from history, sociology, and the arts to explore the origins of L.A.’s original artistic and creative culture in the Arroyo Seco and its contemporary reemergence in the Northeast L.A. art scene. At the turn of the twentieth century, a celebrated and irreverent “Arroyo Culture” of Arts and Crafts architects, designers, printers, and writers came to prominence in Southern California and across the Southwest and the nation. Yet that Northeast Los Angeles artistic bohemia dissipated by mid-century through freeway construction, disinvestment, and white flight. Gradually, the cultures of the Arroyo region dropped out of the larger consciousness. In this class, we will trace the hidden history of the individual makers and arts collectives that flourished even during these years of obscurity, along with the rise of a new, distinctively Latino expressive culture that would break back into the metropolitan consciousness by the 1970s. Faced with new challenges of gentrification and the continually changing cultures of Northeast LA, we will also explore how the Arroyo region continues to shape our contemporary artistic and bohemian creative culture in twenty-first century Los Angeles. In the process, we will connect students with heritage and arts organizations to do field interviews and archival research. History and sociology studies of bohemia and neo-bohemia will help contextualize our explorations of the role of the arts in defining regional identity and as factors in economic development and community life.

CSP 59 From the Phonograph to Auto-Tune: Exploring the Cultures of Recorded Music
Writing in 1906, the American composer John Phillip Sousa expressed grave concerns about what he termed the "menace of mechanical music." According to Sousa, the advent of devices like the player piano and the phonograph threatened to remove "the human skill, intelligence, and soul" from music and reduce it to little more than "a mathematical system of megaphones, wheels, cogs, disks, and cylinders." More than a century later, musicians and audiences today have embraced musical technology in ways that would have been inconceivable in Sousa's time. How did the introduction of such technologies transform musical culture at the turn of the twentieth century? And how has the subsequent development of new musical technologies changed the way people both produce and listen to music? Through the examination of a diverse range of literature, films, archival materials, and sound recordings, this course will explore the complex and continually evolving relationship between music and technology -- from the primitive phonograph introduced by Thomas Edison in 1877 to vibrant culture of digital sampling, MP3s, and Auto-Tune of the present day.

CSP 60 Black Paris: Diasporic Connections in the City of Light
During the first part of the 20th century Paris was an international hub of intellectual and creative activity. For black Americans, in particular, Paris held the promise of “liberty, equality, and (interracial) fraternity.” There they established connections with African and Caribbean thinkers resulting in an explosion of cultural production that would influence French culture and transform the future of people of African descent. This course will examine black internationalism as experienced in Paris during the Interwar period and the decade following World War II, focusing on themes such as Pan-Africanism, the Harlem Renaissance New Negro, the Jazz Age, and Negritude. Readings will include works by and about figures such as W.E.B. Du Bois, Langston Hughes, Josephine Baker, James Baldwin, Aimé Césaire, and Léopold Senghor.

CSP 61 Racial Crossings in 20th Century Hollywood Films
This course uses Hollywood film from the silent era to the end of the 20th century to examine changing American attitudes to racial crossings of all kinds. The focus of our class discussions will be on how these films have created, shaped, or broken images of the raced other in America. With the films as our starting point for discussion and analysis, we will explore Hollywood presentations of passing for white, interracial romance, and mixed race characters. As a second semester course in the Cultural Studies Program, the development and exercise of critical thinking and writing skills will be central to all class assignments.

CSP 62 Representing Los Angeles: Imagined Spaces, Living Places
As a major U.S. city that grew in importance during a time of increasing globalization, Los Angeles occupies a unique position within the cultural imagination. This course will explore how the unique geographical and cultural space of Los Angeles has contributed to ways in which the city has been imagined and represented in literature and film. In our explorations, we will consider how L.A.’s roots, migrating populations, shifting community boundaries, and multiple forms of power shape imaginings and lived realities of the city. How do various representations reflect – and diverge from – living communities within Los Angeles? How are the city and its communities shaped by national and global forces? How has Los Angeles as a destination city for migrants shaped the ways it is imagined? How do we reconcile the dueling representations of L.A. as both utopia and dystopia? Over the course of the semester, we will examine a broad range of film and literature that will guide our discussion of these and other questions, interrogating what it means to live in the city of Los Angeles. In addition, the course will include a community-based research project on gentrification in the Highland Park neighborhood by campus.

CSP 64 Monsters: Imagining Race, Nation, and Class
We often think of popular culture as a kind of distraction; we watch films or read novels to escape the real world and its problems. What would be the point of studying "monsters" in literature and film if the books and movies exist only to allow us to escape reality? This course will begin by rejecting these assumptions. By looking at the history of the concept of the monster and by looking at those particular modern monsters, such as Frankenstein's monster and Dracula, we can see the ways in which anxieties about the purity and impurity of race and nation, about who belongs and who doesn't belong to a community, about those who cannot or will not assimilate and thus threaten the body in which they have no place are explored in greater detail than anywhere else. We will ask why race is foregrounded in the contemporary zombie film (a genre which has its origins in the former slave colony of Haiti) and what reality is captured in one its most important conventions, the "necessary" killing of children. We may discover that these forms of popular culture reveal what is most disturbing and dangerous about the societies that produce them, not least our own.
In addition to novels and films, we will read Aristotle, Hobbes, Locke, Foucault and Agamben.

This seminar examines how Latina/os have been represented in U.S. film and television since the early twentieth century and how these images have changed over time in response to social and political change. Particular emphasis will be given to themes of class, gender, sexuality, race and ethnicity as we deconstruct the stereotypes of Latin lovers, bandits, vixens, maids, gangsters, and immigrants. We will also consider how Latina/o self-representation and anti-stereotyping have subverted and resisted these images. Attention to transnational political contexts as well as theoretical frameworks and methodological approaches for cultural analysis will ground class discussions and research projects.

This course explores the relationship between music and consciousness in different world cultures with the intention of developing an understanding of the role that music plays in ecstatic experiences. Through a survey of various cultures, we will delve into various dimensions of how music operates in culture as an intrinsic part of altered states of consciousness in the human quest for a spiritual connection. This course draws on ethnomusicology, psychology, anthropology, music therapy, dance ethnology, and religious studies. Emphasis will placed upon developing excellent writing skills, research skills, and critical thinking in order to produce a strong and cogent final research paper.

Did you know that if you find a dime in a phone booth you are much more likely to help someone in need? That it might be better to make important decisions in your life based, not on your careful reflection on the matter, but on your gut feelings? In this course we will investigate cutting-edge research in psychology that upends deeply held convictions about our moral behavior. We will examine the implications that this research has in our moral landscape by examining the contributions that different contemporary philosophers have made to this body of research. In the last part of the course we will reflect on how this research can help us understand and address some pressing social justice issues in the Eagle Rock community in particular and the LA area in general.

CSP 69 Debating Controversial Issues in Sexuality
This course introduces four theoretical perspectives on sexuality: biological (sexuality is a matter of sexual bodies and chemistry), psychological (sexuality is a matter of mental states and processes), social constructionist (sexuality is a cultural and historical product), and conflict (sexuality is a contested arena in which different groups vie for power). With these perspectives in mind, we explore four broad questions: How should we regulate sexual behavior? What is sexual consent? Who's responsible for the fact that sex makes babies? And, what is good sex?

CSP 70 Japan and Korea Through Film and Fiction
In Democracy in America, Tocqueville gives a picture of the people who governed themselves in America as self-important, anti-intellectual, racist religious zealots who were mostly driven by self-interest with little concern for the public’s interest.  Yet, Tocqueville also claimed that when these vile individuals constituted a public in the New England townships with the aim of carrying out public business, the virtues of American democracy were made manifest. This course will take as a starting point Tocqueville’s insight about the secret of a nascent American democracy – the New England’s townships, a particular kind of democratic public that unleashes the virtue of democracy through the natural vice of its people – to examine the possibility of democratic publics in restoring American democracy in the twenty-first century.  The class will be devoted to reading political and philosophical texts that suggest that the shape and function of our public spheres, counter-publics, and political spaces are essential for the preservation of democracy.  There will also be a community-based component of the class that requires students to critically engage and actually participate in a democratic public in Los Angeles.

CSP 71 Existentialism
Existentialism is a philosophy that grapples with the problem of human freedom and moral choice in a world that often seems devoid of transcendental meaning or purpose.  In this course we will read literary and philosophical texts from the French, German, Hispanic, and Russian existentialist traditions, and will explore the structures and possibilities of consciousness, knowledge, desire, imagination, aesthetics, ethics, and political commitment. Authors studied will include Albert Camus, Fydor Dostoevsky, Franz Kafka, Eduardo Mallea, Ernesto Sábato, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Leo Tolstoy.

CSP 74 Teaching Social Justice Through Children's Literature
Traditionally, we often think of children's literature as offering young readers a rosy, almost naive portrait of the world they live in. Yet modern and contemporary writers of children's fiction have innovated substantially on this model, using children's literature as a platform for drawing attention to social injustice and for galvanizing children to recognize and resist these inequities. In both historical fiction and texts set in today's world, authors ranging from Mildred Taylor and Louise Erdrich to Laurie Halse Anderson and Sherman Alexie have written texts intended for junior high and high school readers that nevertheless tackle issues ranging from racial injustice and settler colonialism to rape culture and socioeconomic inequality. Even picture books written for elementary schoolers can broach similar topics, as examples by famed authors Ntozake Shange and Chinua Achebe have shown. Students in this course will examine some of these boundary-pushing representations by writers living in the United States from the 1970s through the present, considering them alongside earlier, less revolutionary children's novels by Laura Ingalls Wilder and Frances Hodgson Burnett. Theories of children's literature and research on its potential effects on young readers will also form a foundation for our analyses.

What former CSP 99 students have said...
"In many ways your time at College is defined by academics and what happens in the classroom. Learning how to prepare for class, take tests, and even reflect are all crucial parts of the academic process.  Something that I think needs to be stressed more often is the visceral, exploratory nature of a program like CSP 99.  Throughout the semester, I have learned to appreciate different forms of expression, and how people are able to approach even simple tasks with very different strategies."
"Experiencing the arts offers students a unique opportunity to enjoy a variety of events put on by College College. These events provide a chance to expand ones intellectual engagement and increase ones musical interest. Authors, musicians, plays, and dynamic films are all offered to broaden students wealth of knowledge. These events reach out into the Los Angeles community to bring various professionals onto campus where they can engage the minds of College’s youth. They provide students with an opportunity to learn about various professions from those who have found success. I have acquired a new wealth of knowledge from participating in these events."
"All of the events I attended this semester were more intriguing than initially expected. Based on other students who had previously taken the class I figured the events would be insightful but my experiences with the events were more impactful than others credited."

CTSJ 265 Feminist Rhetoric and Social Change
This course is an introduction to feminist rhetorical history and criticism as it foregrounds the study of how women "stand and speak" using rhetorical strategies to address social and cultural issues that impact them. This class positions the study of feminist rhetorics within the larger study of language and discourse theories as we examine how social relations power knowledge and identities are constituted through private and public rhetorical acts. Through our readings we will engage a wide range of contributions to a rhetorical critical history by women who either as practitioners or theorists advanced their visions of social change and acted to implement them. Course readings will begin in antiquity to provide a foundation for our study though much of our material will focus on texts from the nineteenth-century to the present to examine the intersections of gender and rhetoric. Through this work we will challenge the seeming erasure of women from this critical history and interrogate the notion of "feminist rhetoric" as merely a corollary to a masculinist tradition. Assignments will include critical essays and a visual rhetoric project on representations of women in the media and popular culture. Same as WRD 265

DWA 229 Introduction to Human Rights: Focus on the Americas
After a review of the historical legal and conceptual underpinnings of the international protection of human rights students in this course will learn about human rights and mechanisms for their protection within the context of the United States and Latin America. Students will discuss key situations from the last half century involving challenges to human rights including the phenomenon of disappearances common in Argentina and Chile in the 1970s the application of the death penalty in the United States and the current "war on drugs" in Mexico and Central America.

DWA 241 International Relations of the Middle East
A study of Middle-Eastern international relations in the context of three themes that structure the region's modern political history: 1. Colonialism: how the reaction against colonialism continued to define and limit Middle-Eastern politics both internally and in its relations with outside powers. 2. Religion: in particular political Islam (or "fundamentalism") is a key variable in the region's contemporary politics but by no means all-defining. 3. Nationalism(s): a source of political identity and mobilization. How religious national linguistic and ethnic nationalisms inform conflict and cooperation within the region.
In the context of these three themes we will explore the following regional issues with global implications: 1. The Arab-Israeli conflict. The flash point of conflict in the Middle-East the Arab-Israeli conflict can only be understood on the basis of an informed appreciation of its historical and ideological underpinnings. 2. Iran. The Iranian revolution had an enormous impact on regional and international affairs. Current unrest within Iran is perhaps a harbinger of yet another radical shift in Iranian politics. 3. Domestic upheaval in the region as seen in the Arab uprisings of 2011-12. .
Despite this being an "IR" class on-the-ground social and political movements ("domestic" yet transnationally informed) have an enormous impact on the region's politics. This is particularly true in the shadow of the recent Arab uprisings on which we will place particular attention.

DWA 242 Revolutionary Iran in Historical Perspective
Iran has experienced crisis revolts and revolution more than any other country in the region. The level of revolutionary zeal ideological debates and mass participation has elicited unprecedented attention by media experts and academics's endeavoring to resolve what is termed as "Persian Puzzle" or "Iranian Paradox". In view of remarkable infrequency of revolutions Nikki Keddie - the eminent scholar of modern Iran - has devoted years of research in striving to answer the question "why has Iran been revolutionary?" She reiterates that Iran has seen more modern revolutions than any country in the Muslim world and more than most countries anywhere. Consequently the course on "Revolutionary Iran" addresses the following question: Is there anything peculiar or particular about Iran that could explain the rise of modern revolutionary movement? The course critically examines the theoretical and historical perspectives that have been proposed to answer this question.

DWA 250 International Security
This course is an introduction to international security and strategic studies. This field is fundamentally about both the use of force by and violent conflict among states and non-state actors. The course will be guided by general theoretical questions regarding security: How does violent conflict or competitions shaped by the lurking possibili¬ty of such conflict affect international relations and individual societies? How has the role of violent conflict in international politics changed since the end of World War II? What is the nature of security today? These general questions will frame explorations of more specific strategic questions. Such questions will include: How do states and non-state actors use force to persuade their enemies to take (coercion) or refrain from taking (deterrence) a particular action? How can nations best prepare to prevent violent conflicts or to win them if they occur? What has determined success and failure the intensity duration and consequences of military action? We will have a particular focus on emerging transnational security issues intra-state security and the relationship among security development and state failure. Pursuing answers to these questions will require an approach that integrates theory history and current events. Same as POLS 233

DWA 252 Security Issues in South Asia
While Washington policymakers during the Cold War paid only episodic attention to South Asia the region has become a focal point for U.S. security policy over the last decade or so. Since the nuclear weapon tests by India and Pakistan in 1998 their entrenched conflict-prone strategic rivalry has acquired a much more dangerous edge. The region is also the epicenter of global terrorism with Islamabad simultaneously acting as a sponsor of the Taliban forces fighting in Afghanistan and serving as a pivotal U.S. ally in the war against Islamist terrorism. Finally after decades of disdain about India's strategic potential U.S. officials have invested singular energy in recent years in developing what is a tacitly anti-China security partnership with India. Although South Asia encompasses a number of countries this course will focus on the region's two most important powers - India and Pakistan - and their relationships with the United States and China - the two extra-regional powers that have the most influence on regional affairs. The following topics will receive special attention: The sources of and prospects for the India-Pakistan strategic rivalry including the long-standing territorial dispute over Kashmir and the more recent competition for influence in Afghanistan. The effects of nuclear proliferation on India-Pakistan interactions. The economic rise of India and its implications for New Delhi's security posture especially vis-à-vis Islamabad Washington and Beijing Pakistan's national prospects and their security implications. China's growing role in regional security affairs The emergence of non-traditional security challenges in the region (e.g. conflicts over access to natural resources population pressures.) The impact of South Asian security issues on U.S. strategic interests the development of U.S. bilateral relations with India and Pakistan and the management of the triangular relationship.

DWA 253 Security in Asia
China's return (as opposed to rise) to its proportional place in the global economy has arguably caused a pivot towards Asia by the United States. While America's hegemonic status in terms of hard (military) power remains undisputed China's gross domestic product may surpass that of the United States as soon as 2017. This course is a seminar on Asian security covering military security non-traditional security and economic and political security among other dimensions. The course surveys the Asian region with particular emphasis on Southeast Asia (the ASEAN countries particularly Cambodia Burma/Myanmar Thailand and Singapore) and Northeast Asia (China Japan South Korea and Taiwan). The material is divided into three parts. The first provides an overall introduction and overview of Asian security and focuses on the foundations of what was thought to be the Asian Miracle (created in part from a US security umbrella) just as the Washington Consensus rose to prominence. It takes students through the Asian Financial Crisis and its aftermath. Part II of the classes focuses on Japan South Korea China and Taiwan. It describes their development trajectories and security arrangements. Part III uses China as a platform to examine other parts of Asia not already covered such as China's relationship with Southeast Asia and the political economy of non-traditional security in particular the region's experience with Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza.

The course will then go on to discuss certain policy responses that have elicited particular concern such as torture assassination surveillance programs detention without trial and deliberate entrapment. Cyborg Zombie and Lord of The Ring allegories will serve to illustrate different conceptual and practical approaches to terrorism. The course will conclude with an examination of the different implications for policy decision making suggested by the use of different allegories.

DWA 256 International Terrorism
The course analyses terrorism not only from a state security perspective, but also one informed by political ethics, in which we seek to come to terms with the demands of justice in an age of violence resulting in large numbers of civilian deaths by both state and non-state actors. Broad questions include: What is terrorism? What are it causes? What are its consequences? Do terrorists operate from internally consistent and intelligible (even if horrific) frameworks? Must we sacrifice some of our cherished civil liberties in order to protect others? And what international moral and legal principles should guide us in an age cyber warfare, drone strikes, and targeted assassinations?

DWA 331 Ethics, Religion, and International Relations - State Interest vs. Universal Morality?
An inquiry into the field of ethical inquiry in international relations with a particular focus on the increasing recognition of the multiple frames of ethics contributed by the world's religions.  It is intended as an introduction for students who already have some background in the field of international relations and are interested in exploring the subject at a deeper level. Ethics has traditionally occupied an unenvious position in mainstream theories of international relations. Either it has been relegated to the margins of the field or placed in opposition to the contingencies of state practice. Denying their own normative foundations (Western) theories of international relations traditionally ignored the relevance of ethics for the conceptualization and practice of world politics. This course reviews alternative approaches to traditional international relations theory by placing ethics at the center of the field.  The course focuses on the ethical underpinnings of state practice and analyzes a range of contemporary foreign policy issues in which ethical questions are likely to arise especially the protection of human rights the historical development and contemporary formulations of ethical norms for the use of force and distributive justice in the global economy.  Special emphasis will be given to religious influences on national ethics; religion as a matter of conflict; religious communities as transnational agents for justice protection of human rights and peace; and ethical and religious contributions to reconciliation solidarity and peacemaking. The theme to be explored in this course is "State Interest vs. Universal Morality?" - that is we will explore the question of whether or not these two dimensions of international relations are compatible or competitive with each other.

Accordingly this course is divided into three sections. The first section offers a historical/philosophical overview of the rise of and a variety of challenges to the idea of democracy as both a political ideal and an institutional form from the advent of the American and French revolutions to today.

The Great Depression of the 1930s was the most significant crisis of capitalism in modern history. It was global in its reach decreasing economic output and production and bringing international trade and finance to a halt. Businesses and households suffered from banking crises the restriction of credit as well as the loss of employment.

ENGL 155 Science as Fiction -- Philip K. Dick
One version of science fiction extrapolates the technical and cultural trajectory of its society into a dystopian or utopian future. Another takes issue with the scientific method and finds in that rationalistic and metrical analysis a materialized and reductionist illusion as to the complexities of existence. From this second perspective, it is science and not literature that is the delusional fiction. Perhaps, the greatest author of this second type is Philip K. Dick. This class will read some of his weird and psychologically challenging short stories and novels against their historical antecedents such as Frankenstein, and try to understand their startling quarrel with realism and the more generally accepted logical portrait of the world. To visualize his creative deviation, we will also analyze a couple of the many movies based on his work. This class is tailored for first and second year students who have done little college level work in literature.

ENGL 178 Shakespeare and Film
In late 16th and early 17th-century England, Shakespeare was part of a complex theatrical world that produced drama of supreme intensity, and his works continue to exert their force in our contemporary global world, both in theater and in film. Shakespeare's plays have, in fact, been adapted to film more than those of any other author in any language. This class will read some of Shakespeare's most complex and interesting plays and examine film adaptations from around the world. We will pay special attention to the evolution of Shakespeare's tragic vision, and its possible redemption in his late romance plays, in order to trace his experimental development of dramatic form, poetic style, characterization, and ideology. We will also work to understand how films enliven the complex, unruly energies that characterize Shakespeare's work, extending these experiments through adaptation, mimicry, appropriation, and displacement.

Focusing primarily on literary and filmic representations of the sexual racial legal and economic "taboo" in works including Charles Dickens' Great Expectations E.M. Forester's Passage to India and Djuna Barnes' Nightwood we will seek to uncover the terms of normativity against which the figure of the deviant emerges into representation. We will supplement our analysis of literature with readings from a range of theoretical methodologies from psychoanalysis legal theory Marxist/economic theory to postcolonial and critical race studies. Major requirement met: Group II/IV.

ENGL 273 American Poetry, Politics, and Pleasure
Today, poetry is less often studied than prose or film. However, for American poets between the 18th and 20th centuries, poetry was a primary technology for the liberation of feeling and, by that, a challenge to the political status quo. Verse was seen as a process whereby the poet and the reader overcame the ideological habituations of a prosaic and controlling world of isolation, money, and pragmatism. Thus, this genre constituted as existential revolt against capitalization through the unfettering of emotions from excessive familiarity and cliché.  This class will expect no previous knowledge of the genre. After a sufficient but brief introduction to the methods of verse, we will undertake an immersion in a very few and brief poems from writers including Wheatley, Bradstreet, Poe, Whitman, Ginsberg, Plath, and Stevens.

ENGL 288 Modern British Literary Traditions
Monsters and Monstrosity: Literature is rife with portraits of monsters and monstrosity. From Homer's The Odyssey and Grimm's fairytales to Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and Salman Rushdie's Shame monsters challenge our everyday ideas about normality. Situated between the animal and the human monstrous creatures are ciphers for difference that force us to consider what we regard as culturally abject or grotesque as well as alluring. That these mythical figures continue to fascinate even as they frighten suggests their symbolic power in embodying both our latent desires and prohibitions. This course will explore the emergence of the monstrous aesthetic across several genres (epic drama novel poetry film) and periods (renaissance to contemporary) to probe the shifting terrains of sexual racial and cultural otherness that monsters represent. Along the way we will ask critical questions that arise from the study of monstrosity. What for instance separates monsters from humans? How does monstrosity define our notions about beauty and ugliness desire and disgust? Does the monster appear each time under a different guise? If so to what extent does it reshape our sensibility about what is socially abnormal? What can monsters teach us about the hopes and apprehensions of the cultures and times to which they belong? Ultimately we will seek to understand how and why these ferocious figures also elicit sympathy in us toward those markedly unlike ourselves. Our reading list includes works by Alfred Tennyson William Blake R.L. Stevenson Mary Shelley Patricia Highsmith among others.

Examining death in the imaginative and meditative culture of the 14th and early 15th centuries this seminar will introduce advanced students to a wide range of Middle English literature. No prior knowledge of Middle English or medieval literature required. We will contextualize our work by looking at religious philosophical and medical texts about death yet our focus will be on scenes of death burial mourning and memorial in literary texts by Chaucer the Pearl Poet Julian of Norwich and others. Asking how we can construe the ethical and political imagination of the medieval English literary world we will also consider larger issues related to the literary awareness of death: the representability of death; the political and generic function of consolation tragedy and elegy; death?s relations to the sacred and the sovereign; the economics of death in the age of the plague; war and martyrdom; mourning and rebellion; dreams and the afterlife; gender living death and anchoritism.

ENGL 311 Premodern Romance
Akin to the novel in modernity, romance was one of the most important genres of imaginative literature in medieval and early modern England (and Europe more generally) and yet it was also the one that provoked the most profound moral and aesthetic concern. Hugely popular, romance was often condemned for its endless attention to pleasure, pain, and error, for its perverse magical stories of quest and exploration, for its unseemly analysis of chivalric duty and obsession -- and even for its capacity to corrupt its readers beyond repair. Whether viewed as a genre of utopian dreaming or of lurid and dangerous narrative failure, romance is a vexed concept.  By examining premodern and modern genre theory, this class will explore the formation of the category of romance across medieval and Renaissance England (with some attention paid to France, Italy, and Spain), thus giving students an opportunity to consider how genre can enable and constrain understanding of particular works of literature. We will focus the majority of our attention on two of the most anomalous expressions of the genre: Geoffrey Chaucer's Troilus and Crisyede and several books of Edmund Spenser's The Faerie Queene. These poems relentlessly reflect on their own status as romances; their examinations of story-telling and power, gender and sexuality, spectacle and violence are acute. At the end of the semester, we may turn to more recent speculative fictions (such as Samuel R. Delany's Nova) to get a sense of how premodern romance remains an archive for some of the most exciting cultural production today.

ENGL 322 Renaissance Literature
This class explores early British literature with an emphasis on literary representations of punishment and the passions. The Renaissance and Reformation in England witnessed the emergence of more centralized institutions to police sin and illegality in society to tame passions whether devotional or political that could unsettle the developing sovereignty of the modern state. We will examine how literary texts represent and respond to such larger political and theological shifts in punishment. Some of the most innovative and exciting works of drama poetry and prose in this period struggle with the purpose and effects of confinement imprisonment slavery and penance. Topics will include: the normalization of punishment through legal centralization; the relationship between punishment and the humanistic culture of teaching; the relationship between domestic and colonial punishment; revenge and forgiveness; race gender sexuality and punishment; punishment and class hierarchy; violence and equity; sin and salvation; self-punishment and penance; punishment and spectacle; the ethics of witnessing punishment; slavery and revolt. Authors include: Machiavelli Thomas More Anne Lock Spenser Shakespeare Donne Milton Hobbes and Aphra Behn.

ENGL 341 Race, Law, and Literature
This course interrogates the crucial role of the law in British imperial governance by reading colonial legislation and court proceedings alongside works of nineteenth and early twentieth century literature.  Doing this allows us to examine how dominant legal paradigms were disseminated in the era's cultural production and in turn how cultural ideals reflected in literature were materially implemented through the law.  In addition we will look at how literature often provided a viable means of contesting the normative terms of the law. Major requirement met: Group II/IV.

ENGL 345 American Literature Before 1900
The Literature of Non-Representation: In the Greek and Judeo-Christian traditions literature is usually understood as an untrue copy of the "real." As such it has often been devalued as morally suspect and materially empty. However this perspective was itself inverted by some American literature of the 18th and 19thcenturies. In this contrarian view literature is the activity of realization itself and the literal and scientific modalities are fictions lost in their habitual misunderstandings. For these opposing writers the poetic process constitutes the reader's dissolving emersion in the real without need of conceptual replica. This class will try to understand this non-representational view with primary concentration on the poems of Whitman and Dickinson bracketed by the previous practices of Bradstreet Wheatley Emerson and Poe. Major requirement met: Group II

ENGL 365 Contemporary Literature
Violence and Representation:
This course will interrogate Fanon's assertions that the colonized find their freedom only through violence and that decolonization is always a violent process by considering the structuring dialectics between violence the body and postcolonial narratives of insurgency. If for Fanon decolonization is both literally and linguistically an adopted violence so that militancy against colonialism is an answer back in the imported language of destruction that the colonizer best understands our goal will be to investigate the complex and shifting relations to violence/violation that postcolonial texts elaborate when they represent insurgent anticolonial practices. By looking closely at how postcolonial narratives represent insurgencies against power and their attendant violences we will arrive at an analytic for addressing the technologies of pain trauma brutality torture and repression that conditioned regimes of colonial discipline and control. We will also consider the extent to which postcolonial texts appropriate an apparatus of violence in representing bodies in rebellion while also articulating alternative visions of resistance and social change that specifically refuse the ethics of extremism. Our inquiry will draw from a critical discourse on corporeality (Foucault Scarry) the nation (Fanon Anderson) and gender (Butler Spivak) to illuminate the peculiar charge in narratives of insurgency between the embodied politics of militancy and the body politic. Finally the texts which we will be reading deal in some way with the problematic of form (how to represent the urgency of politicized violence as a condition of modernity) and in so doing reach beyond realist conventions to reflect aspects of the surreal the grotesque the spectacular and the magically real. We will assess the efficacy of these forms and their overwrought symbolism in managing the economy between the public and the private victims and perpetrators masculinity and femininity and whites and blacks which structured the play of colonial violence itself. Over the course of the term we will be reading writers as diverse as Roy Coetzee Al-Shaykh Djebar Salih and viewing films such as The Terrorist Bandit Queen and The Battle of Algiers.

ENGL 390 Junior Seminar in English
The Junior Seminar is a small discussion-oriented seminar required of all majors emphasizing advanced critical approaches to a literary topic. Enrollment is restricted to English majors who will pass the College 3rd Year Writing Requirement by satisfactory completion of the course writing requirements.
Objects of Beauty:
In her recent book On Beauty and Being Just Elaine Scarry makes the claim that "At the moment we see something beautiful we undergo a radical decentering."  Others might suggest that notions of beauty have been used precisely to center certain normative standards often violently marginalizing those who do not adhere.  Whether dismissed as frivolous theorized as a philosophical category of inquiry or politicized in the service of feminist or anti-racist discourse beauty does many things: it captivates it incites pleasure and desire it oppresses and subjugates and it excludes.  Throughout the course of this term we will evaluate Scarry's claim looking at texts dealing with both theoretical and practical aspects of aesthetic experience.  Beginning with Aristotle we will evaluate Western theorizations of beauty through the Enlightenment and into the contemporary era.  In addition we will look at how non-Western writers have responded to aesthetic norms imposed upon them.  Texts such as Pierre Bourdieu's Distinction and Maxine Craig's Ain't I a Beauty Queen will provide a framework for examining how politics of race class and gender shape questions of aesthetic value.  Within this theoretical context we will consider representations of beauty in print and visual culture including popular cinema and literature.  Throughout the term we will focus on developing tools of scholarly analysis written and verbal.  Each student will be expected to engage in detailed and incisive discussions of each work and write a formal research paper. (Fall)
Love and Death in Contemporary American Novels:
The study of works by Toni Morrison Alice Walker Louise Erdrich Leslie Marmon Silko Michael Ondaatje and Junot Diaz will enable us to explore the forms that love takes when it is grounded in the tumultuous histories of African American Native American or Dominican American people.  The theoretical frameworks for reading will be provided by narrative theory and psychoanalytic theory.  The course will give particular attention to the narrative forms of these novels by contemporary writers of color. (Spring)
Junior Seminar in English: Lyric Forms:
This junior seminar will explore the development of lyric poetry (especially sonnets, elegies, odes, pastoral poems, and devotional and love lyrics) and of theoretical reflections on what lyric is and does in Anglophone modernity. Canvassing the ways “lyric” has functioned as a term for particular kinds of expression, thought, and classification--and even as a paradigm for interpretation itself--this class will provide students with a set of tools to read closely and write about an archive of lyric poetry from the 16th-century to the contemporary moment. Even though it is ostensibly the most personal and hermetic of literary genres, lyric perpetually reveals what the philosopher Theodor Adorno calls a “collective undercurrent,” a complex relay between word and world, the expressivity of an individual poetic voice and the social structures that shape the forms and possibilities of expression. We will, for that reason, attend to how lyric has crystalized different historically situated understandings of self and society, of longing and loss, with an eye towards how the form of a short poem, how it sounds and feels and means, exposes aesthetic, philosophical, and political questions of great urgency.

GERM 282 Nazi Visual Culture
The rise and fall of National Socialism is one of the most intensively studied topics in European history. Over six decades after its collapse Nazi Germany continues to fascinate the general public and with good reason. Although the fascist state lasted only for twelve years it started history's most destructive war while committing crimes of unprecedented proportions. For the most part it did so with the acquiescence of the German public. This class will investigate the rise of National Socialism as a political social and cultural phenomenon. The central focus will be on the decisive role of film and the visual arts as most popular means of mass manipulation.

GERM 288 The Neo-Nazi Movement
Decades after the fall of Nazi Germany there is a growing concern that the spirit of Nazism still lives on. The Neo-Nazi movement continues to exist in Germany. A recent report revealed that one out of twenty 15-year- old boys belong to a Neo-Nazi group. Neo-Nazism is not an exclusively German phenomenon though - we find similar developments in other European countries in Canada and in the US. This course will track the activities of Neo-Nazis in Germany from 1990 to the present. We will analyze the impact of unification on the growth of right wing militancy throughout Germany and examine examples of Neo-Nazi and skinhead activities as well as the efforts of various governments to control this movement. A key question will be why exactly young people between 15 and 30 are drawn to these groups who often use and develop sophisticated networks. Finally the question will be asked what the most effective means of combating these movements would or should be.

GERM 320 Metamorphic Bodies: Fluid Forms from Ovid to Kafka
"To speak of forms changed into new bodies [...] from the very beginning of the world up to my own times." Thus begins Ovid's Metamorphoses, whose programmatic opening stanza links the the birth of the world from formlessness and chaos to a narrative principle of transformation and change over time. This course will explore the shifting conceptions of metamorphosis -- the transformation of "forms [...] into new bodies," and vice versa -- from its mythic origins in Ovid to its modern manifestations and modulations in the works of Goethe, Darwin, and Kafka. Throughout the course, we will examine the ambiguous relationship between "forms" and "bodies" in Western thought and how the permutations of this nexus come to bear on a wide variety of different topics in the humanities, including myths and theories of changing forms in nature (plants, clouds, animals); dynamic representations of gender, sexuality, and erotics; as well as figures of hybridity and the grotesque (human-animal hybrids, beasts, and monstrosities). More broadly, the course will explore the porous interfaces between ancient and modern poetics, myth and modernity, as well as the arts and sciences. This course will meet three times a week, twice with CSLC 120, and a third weekly meeting in which all readings and discussion will be conducted in German.

Same as CSLC 220 (4 Units). This course is concerned with the cultural politics of memory and trauma after 1945. We will start with basic questions such as: Whose memories are sought believed and commemorated in the public sphere? What problems do traumatic events present for those attempting to represent them? Is trauma a useful cultural concept? What are the differences between individual and collective memory? We will then identify the recent fascination especially in European and American culture with the phenomenon of trauma suffering and victimhood and focus on the impact on Jewish identity(in various countries)as well as the collective memory of Germans after 1945.

GERM 325 Crisis in Europe
The European project - i.e. the gradual unification of the continent - which had been successful for decades seems to undergo a fundamental crisis at present. This crisis has different aspects. Primarily it has to do with the economic inequities within the European Union which became tangible in the aftermath of the world economic crisis of 2008. In its wake the "weaker" economies mostly at the periphery were more affected than the stronger ones. But there also other problems such as the lack of democratic structures as well as strong leadership the weight of a centralized bureaucracy and the lack of a European public sphere. The course will take a look at the achievements of the European Union  the multiple reasons for its current crisis and the various attempts to overcome it.

GERM 370 Seminar on a Selected Topic
Bertolt Brecht and the Twenties:
Bertolt Brecht is one of the most influential playwrights and aesthetic thinkers of the 20th century. In order to understand the scope and dimension of his work and its world wide influence this course will focus on the artistic development of young Bertolt Brecht who in the early Twenties moved to Berlin the capital of newly founded democratic Weimar Republic and one of the most important cultural centers of the 20th century and participated in practically all innovative tendencies and art forms of the time from Expressionism and Dadaism to New Objectivity from experimental theatre to radio and film. Some of his great early works such as the "Three Penny Opera" will be seen in the context of the time especially the very turbulent last years of the Weimar Republic before Hitler's rise to power. We will also look at Brecht's legendary film "Kuhle Wampe" and visit at least one contemporary production of a Brecht play staged at a theatre in Los Angeles.
Bertolt Brecht: The Great Plays:
Brecht's great plays changed the stage of world theatre. In order to understand and appreciate their powerful and long lasting influence all major plays written during Brecht's exile i.e. in the years between 1933 when he was driven out of Germany and 1948 when he returned to Switzerland and ultimately Berlin will be discussed. Aside from detailed analyses of plays such as "Mother Courage" "The Good Woman of Sezuan" "The Caucasian Chalk Circle" or "Life of Galilei" Brecht's developing theory of epic theatre and the general conditions and dilemmas of exile will be discussed. We will also look at Brecht's role in Hollywood his collaboration on the film "Hangmen Also Die" and his successful attempts to direct his own plays on German and European stages after 1950. Students minoring in German or majoring in Group Languages or IPS will read most of the texts in the original. Prerequisite for German minor and Group Language majors: GERM 202 or GERM 232. Open to all other non-first year students. The course is taught in English no knowledge of German is required.
Memory Trauma and Victim Culture:
This course is concerned with the cultural politics of memory and trauma after the catastrophic events of the Holocaust and World War II. We will start with basic questions such as: Whose memories are sought and commemorated in the public sphere? What problems do traumatic events present for those attempting to represent them? Is trauma a useful cultural concept? What are the differences between individual and collective memory? The first part of the course analyzes memory and trauma on both the individual level and the collective level and turns then to the specific processes that occur when traumatic events are remembered by survivors as well as the collective processes involved when memories of traumatic events such as the Holocaust are shared with an audience who has no first-hand experience of them.- The second part of the course aims to identify the recent fascination especially in European and American culture with the phenomenon of trauma suffering and victimhood. We will study the cultural politics of trauma and memory in relation to two events - the Holocaust and German suffering during World War II. The unit "Holocaust victimhood and American-Jewish identity" explores how the kitsch nature of popular culture representations of the Holocaust (from the Anne Frank movie of to the very successful TV-series Holocaust to the Hollywood movie Schindler's List) created the paradigm for trauma culture at large. The unit "Germans in collective memory between perpetrators and victims" discusses contemporary German memory discourse which primarily focuses on the experience of German suffering as a consequence of the war and the Third Reich. However to recast Germans as victim is highly problematic since the position of victim is already occupied by those people who were persecuted and murdered by the Germans/Nazis. Memory trauma and victimhood are crucial aspects of the experiences of Jews and Germans after 1945. A systematic exploration of these aspects (as manifested in a broad variety of cultural forms) promises important insights into recent history and culture.
Nazi Culture:
After the Nazis came to power in 1933 they took over control of all aspects of German life. One of the first tasks the new government undertook upon their ascension to power was a synchronization of all professional and social organizations with Nazi ideology and policy. Joseph Goebbels Nazi Minister for Popular Enlightenment and Propaganda began an effort to bring German arts and culture in line with Nazi goals. The government purged cultural organizations of Jewish and other officials alleged to be politically suspect or who performed or created art works which Nazi ideologues labeled "degenerate." Some 650 works by such renowned artists as Max Beckmann Marc Chagall Otto Dix Wassily Kandinsky and Paul Klee were declared "degenerate art" and removed from German museums. The Nazi "cultivation of art" also extended to the modern field of cinema theater music architecture youth education and even to the lower levels of popular culture. Throughout the duration of the Nazi regime 'culture' in all its manifestations played a crucial role. Political rallies military parades sports events open air festivals and other skillfully organized events were used from the beginning to suggest a "national awakening" and the "revolutionary spirit" of the new regime. The efforts of the Nazis to regulate German culture corresponded to what historian George Mosse calls an effort "toward a total culture" i.e. an effort to influence at the most basic level the lives and actions of all Germans. This course will explore the various forms of culture during this time and will raise the question to what extent 'Nazi culture' or culture under Nazi domination was capable of stabilizing the regime until its very end in 1945. German minors and group language majors have to complete either GERM 202 or GERM 232 since they will read some of the material in German.
Marx Freud and the Frankfurt School:
This seminar will explore the origins of the world famous Frankfurt School a group of German social philosophers and theoreticians which emerged at the Institute for Social research of the University of Frankfurt am Main in the 1920s who wanted a) to analyze the conditions of modern capitalism and its impact on society in general on family and social structures value systems and mass culture b) critically review the theories of Karl Marx Sigmund Freud and Max Weber and c) to establish the principles and foundations of a 'critical theory.' We'll read and discuss major works by Max Horkheimer Theodor W. Adorno Walter Benjamin Herbert Marcuse Erich Fromm Siegfried Kracauer Leo Loewenthal and others. The seminar will focus on the 'first phase' of the Frankfurt School its beginnings and its work and development during the thirties and forties - when the school relocated to New York and many of its collaborators lived in other American cities or abroad - and the immediate post WWII period. (A second seminar will follow next year and explore the school's development and its world wide impact in the sixties and seventies.) The course is taught in English. Students minoring or majoring in German will read some of the original texts (especially Marx Freud Benjamin and Kracauer) in German. Same as CTSJ 370.
The Frankfurt School 1945 to the Present:
Social Analysis Cultural Theory and Political Action. This seminar will explore the history of the Frankfurt School after World War II when it was re-established in Frankfurt and began to play a crucial role in the development of a 'critical theory' of society and culture during the West German 'economical miracle;' afterwards with the onset of the German (and international) student movement of the mid-Sixties it gained international reputation and impacted social political and cultural discourses in countries like France Great Britain Italy or the United States. We will study primarily some of the major writings of Th. W. Adorno (especially on art music cultural theory and the lessons of Fascism) H. Marcuse (whose writings on social theory and aesthetics on 'repressive tolerance' and 'liberation' exerted a strong influence on the student movement) and of J. Habermas who became one of the most influential European intellectuals in the decades after 1970. This seminar is the continuation of an earlier class on the beginnings of the Frankfurt School and its history until 1945; participation in that earlier seminar is not required. The course is taught in English. Students minoring in German or majoring in Group Language or IPS will read some of the original texts in German.

GRK 380 Hegel, Nietzsche, Heidegger: Tragic Philosophy
This course will meet at the same time as CSLC 280 and for an additional weekly meeting in which we shall translate one tragedy by Sophocles one by Aeschylus from the original Greek. Description for CSLC 280 follows: In this course we shall attempt to come to terms with three of the most important--and provocative--philosophers of the last two hundred years philosophers without whom the great majority of contemporary literary and cultural theory (and much art and literature itself) would essentially be unthinkable. Significantly all three of these philosophers habitually turned to ancient Greek tragedy in the formulation articulation and further elaboration of their thought. In this class we shall therefore attempt to use the experience of Greek tragedy in all its ecstatic strangeness as a powerful point of entry into the difficult yet crucial works these philosophers have bequeathed to us. Major texts to be covered include: the plays of Aeschylus and Sophocles The Phenomenology of Spirit The Birth of Tragedy Thus Spoke Zarathustra Being and Time and Introduction to Metaphysics.

GRK 382 Love's Song: A Poetic Philosophic History

GRK 383 Style and Substance: Philosophy and the Arts
In our many attempts to make "sense" of art, literature, and music, we sometimes forget that what most matters to us about any of the arts, high or low from the books we read and the music we listen to, to the clothes we wear is not their "content" (if they even have any content to speak of) so much as the all important question of their style. In this class, we shall attempt to answer the question of why style matters so deeply to us by relating the history of stylistic preferences (from ancient to modern times) to the history of metaphysics, to the question of Being itself. In other words, this course will test the thesis that our preferences for electric guitar over acoustic, for oil paint over water color, for free verse over iambic pentameter, has less to do with this or that particular thing within the world, than with the way we answer the question of how or why there is a world for us at all. The Greek section of this course will be devoted to translation of The Iliad from the original, paying particular attention to the ways in which the Homeric epic has been received in the almost three millennia since its original appearance; this will give our investigation into the history of style in the West (and its possible metaphysical grounds) a carefully delimited focal point.

HIST 101 United States Culture and Society I
This course is an introduction to early North American/U.S. history reaching from colonization to the Civil War. Of particular interest in this course will be the theme of cross-cultural interactions in the midst of transforming economies an expanding nation and unequal power relations. We will combine a broad introduction to early American history with an in-depth look at five case studies of individuals and communities encountering each other across borders of nation religion race gender ethnicity and class. Each case study offers a unique perspective on the question of how broad economic structures of colonization slavery and the market revolution shaped human encounters between natives and newcomers captives and captors slaves and slaveholders northerners and southerners. Ultimately these case studies encourage a critical rethinking of concepts of liberty equality and democracy which have formed the bedrock of master narratives in United States history. Within the context of these broad sweeping themes we will look closely at primary historical documents produced by men and women of their time period and we will read carefully the arguments of historians in our own time. The class will emphasize history as a process of critical interpretation.

HIST 213 19th Century Black Activism for Abolition and Equality
This course explores free Black political organizing from the American Revolutionary era through Reconstruction. Students will conduct original research into African American activism that stretched from New York to California before and after the U.S. Civil War. We will explore the social networks and political institutions that nineteenth-century African Americans built to fight for civil rights economic justice and an end to chattel slavery. At the heart of the course is a digital humanities component that will involve students in researching the lives and ideas of individual Black activists. At the end of the course we will contribute our collective research to the national website Colored Conventions. While engaged in original historical research students will also be reading exciting scholarship on the rise of free Black communities in the U.S. and the emergence of African American institutions (churches schools press political organizations). We will delve into questions such as: How did free African Americans from leadership to grassroots levels organize for racial equality abolition and community empowerment? How did class structures and gender ideology shape the dynamics of Black organizing? What transnational relationships and Diasporic identities did Black activists build in the protracted struggles for abolition and citizenship?

HIST 277 Women and Community Health
This course explores the history of women as promoters of community health in the diverse cultures of the nineteenth- and twentieth-century United States. Although women have not traditionally held power in mainstream biomedical occupations and institutions women have nevertheless been critical to health and healing in local communities as caregivers activists and even scapegoats for disease. Furthermore women's role in community health has been heavily shaped by gendered constructions of the body disease and wellbeing. Thus while the focus of the course is on the social history of women's health and healing the theoretical framework of the course also aims to explore how ideologies of gender race class and sexuality shape the women's relationship to community health as both caregivers and health-seekers. The course is organized by a set of common themes that cut across time space and racial/ethnic boundaries in U.S. History. Themes include: spirituality and healing; work and health; sexuality and reproduction; activism for health justice.

HIST 295 Topics in History
American Frontiers:
The Frontier is backcountry ghost town cowboys and Indians prairie and homesteaders ranchers and sodbusters. It is more than these familiar images though: the American Frontier is the encounter of the Americas and the Americans - native and immigrant from Europe Asia and Africa - with the rest of the world a historical development that began in 1492 and is still going on today. Although this is a transnational phenomenon this course is primarily concerned with the Frontier in North America and particularly in the American West and in California viewing it simultaneously as place process and myth. In this course we will also be doing our own original research in the College Library's John Lloyd Butler Special Collections on Railroading so students will have a chance to make their own mark upon the American Frontier.
Modern America: US History 1945 to Present:
In this course we will examine the emergence of the U.S. as a world power along with the challenges and realignments that ensued: the persistence and then erosion of the New Deal order with its replacement by a politics more skeptical of a welfare system; the triumph of consumer culture; the growth of social diversity both as an ideal and a reality; and the roles played by social movements especially the civil rights movement the women's movement and the conservative movement. We will use a combination of primary and secondary sources as texts and students in addition will view a number of films from the era. Prerequisite: 1 course in history
U.S. Intellectual History Since 1865:
This course examines major themes in the history of thought and culture in the United States since the late nineteenth century. Among other topics we will consider the modern liberal-progressive tradition and its radical and conservative critics; the uneasy status of religion in a secular intellectual culture; cultural radicalism and feminism; consumer culture and its interpreters; the implications of American ethno-racial pluralism for national identity; the responses of intellectuals to hot and cold wars the Great Depression and the upheavals of the 1960s. In addition course readings and lectures will introduce students to ongoing debates about the public role and responsibilities of intellectuals as a distinct social group. American intellectuals have long struggled to define their vocation as inquirers and critics. In the process they have sought to understand how that vocation might best respond to the demands of a broader public sphere. Their efforts to balance intellectual integrity with civic engagement provide an opportunity to reflect on your own experiences as students and interpreters of the United States and its culture.
Women and American Politics:
A little under one hundred years ago American women were denied the vote. Now women make up 53 percent of the electorate women hold a record proportion of Senate and House seats and the nation has nearly elected a woman president. The change is meaningful yet the U.S. still ranks just 55th on the World Economic Forum's index of women's empowerment.

Sport and Society in the Americas:
Organized sport offers a literal and figurative arena in which national racial and gendered borders are often reinforced or undone. This course explores the ways sports constitute and disrupt social understandings of nation race gender and sexuality within specific national contexts. Students will examine the cultural impact of a range of national pastimes across the Americas: from soccer in Argentina to baseball in Cuba from cricket in Trinidad to college football in the United States. Students will be encouraged to examine these case studies in ways that move beyond comparative nation-based approaches to the study of sports and nation and instead analyze the ways sports operate as transnational phenomena. Students will also consider the impact of sports "beyond the playing field" including the political economy of stadium construction the representation of sport in film and the politics surrounding the persistence of Native American mascots in college and professional sports in the United States. Course materials include works by historians geographers social theorists and journalists who have also been key contributors to the burgeoning field of sports studies.
Afro-America:
This course examines the historical experiences of people of African descent in the Americas from slavery to the present. The guiding questions of this course are: What is Afro-America? Where is it? How can we write the histories of African descended peoples in the region throughout the region? Can the histories of Africans and their descendants be contained within the confines of "nation"? Are there alternative frameworks (transnational and/or Diasporic) that can better enhance our understanding of these histories? While the course will begin in the slavery era most of our attention will focus on the histories of Africans and their descendants after emancipation. Topics we will explore include: the particularities of slavery in the Americas the Haitian Revolution and its impact on articulations of race and nation in the region the emergence of racial segregation (legalized and informal) debates on "racial democracy" the relationship between gender race and empire and recent attempts to write Afro-American histories from "transnational" and "diaspora" perspectives. While historians have written most of the work we will read in this course we will also engage the works of anthropologists and sociologists who have also been key contributors to this scholarship.

How did the institution of slavery shape the lives of southerners differently depending on race class gender and geography? In what ways did the centrality of an institutionalized system of human property shape the social relations and lived experiences of enslaved African Americans common whites slaveholding planters and Native Americans of the South? How did these groups of Southerners draw upon religion violence and ideologies of sex and race both to challenge and reinforce the southern social order?

HIST 390 Research Seminar
History of Consumer Culture in the US 1880-1980:
The consumption of goods services and experiences has been an important element in the history of the United States from the seventeenth century to the present. However the century beginning in 1880 transformed the nation into a modern consumer society. This research seminar provides a lens through which to explore such issues as the impact of mass media on society; the gendered racial ethnic and class issues that shape the experience of consumption; the role of the United States in the global development of modern consumption; and the ways in which the intersections of consumption production and politics shaped the nation. This seminar has two focal points. First reading contemporary historical scholarship provides both models for students' own research and ways of understanding issues such as the power relationships that undergird a consumer society and the moral challenges consumption has posed. Second as the semester proceeds attention will increasingly turn! to original research projects that draw on the widest variety of sources such as visual culture novels newspapers and magazines and the literature of social protest.  What is the intellectual justification of the course? This course examines the rise and significance of consumer culture in the U.S. It will introduce students to important secondary works on consumer culture in the U.S. and will teach research methods and skills.

HIST 395 Special Topics in History
Reading and Writing Los Angeles:
Major urban centers such as Los Angeles have always been evocative locations for cultural representation. The densely packed topographies rich and diverse social interactions and complex hierarchies of power and influence situated in these exemplary places lend them an air of excitement and mystery. These same factors that inspire intriguing urban literature film and journalism also make cities exemplary subjects for historical investigation. In this course we will employ a strategy of documentary archaeology to reconstruct the relations of power race gender and ethnicity embedded in the historical landscapes of Los Angeles during the twentieth century. Through archival research (in College College's Special Collections and elsewhere) close reading of cultural artifacts and careful exploration of scholarly works we will seek to uncover something of the fabric of everyday social history in the noir megalopolis.
Life in the Mosaic: 160 Years of Jews in Los Angeles:
The story of Jews in Los Angeles is both familiar and unique. Familiar because it is a story of the growth of Los Angeles and the mobility of its citizens. Unique because Jews have been at both the center and the margins of influence in the political social and cultural movements that have created contemporary Los Angeles. This course explores from the beginning of the American era to the present day the pivotal roles Jews have played in the shaping of Los Angeles and the reshaping of Jewish identities communities and perspectives by the opportunities and challenges found in Los Angeles. By examining how Jews have negotiated and continue to negotiate the complexities of life in Los Angeles the course offers students an opportunity to consider the processes of social incorporation marginalization and fragmentation against the backdrop of urban development. Using the perspective of one of the many diverse groups that have transformed the region it anchors historical change in a comprehensible narrative. By considering how the place and myth called Los Angeles has shaped Jewish identities the course offers students an occasion to reflect on their own notions of self-identity community and society in the twenty-first century. The course themes and topics are derived from an exhibition to be mounted at the Autry National Center in Spring 2013. Through course assignments and related activities students will be able to contribute to the development of the exhibition with their original research as research and editorial interns and through analytical critiques of various elements of the exhibition. The combination of class and field work will allow students to acquire experience in historical research interpretation and public presentation.
The US Since 1945:
This readings course will focus on the cultural social and political dimensions of the history of the United States from 1945 to the present. Among the topics under consideration will be race ethnicity gender consumer culture religion social movements as well as the intersection between politics culture and globalization. The texts studies will be major books by historians political scientists sociologists and non-fiction authors.
California Since 1940:
California Since 1940 Before World War II California was in many ways an agricultural settler society far removed from the global currents which propelled it to world prominence in previous centuries. But the war transformed the Golden State into an industrial powerhouse and brought dramatic social changes which would define the nation throughout the twentieth century. In this class we begin with the Depression and War to witness the birth of a new noir California particularly in Los Angeles and trace the intersection of military/technological expertise and leisure culture as it produced the counterculture Internet and personal computer revolutions that would once again place California at the center of the world.
The Arts and Public Life in Modern America:
An exploration of the ways in which the arts have influenced public life in the United States since the early 20th century and have in turn been shaped by competing visions of democratic citizenship. In addition to examining the public interventions of artists we will study the history of institutions ranging from museums and government cultural agencies to local community arts groups.  The course combines seminar meetings with visits to area sites and organizations.
Transportation and Place in American History:
How have our ways of moving through the world affected our understandings of familiar spaces around us? Can we think of transportation technology as a form of mass media that has changed over time thus altering perceptions of even the most familiar landscapes? In this course we will explore several historical modes of perceiving and navigating the landscapes of American cities and particularly greater Los Angeles ranging from the pedestrian city to the metropolis of railroads and streetcars (including the famous Pacific Electric system) to the sprawling megalopolis of automobiles and freeways. We might even speculate what a transit and pedestrian Los Angeles of the future might look like - will it be a return to the past or betoken new ways of understanding and organizing our everyday urban spaces? Central to this exploration will be extensive research in the college's John Lloyd Butler Special Collections archives on railroads and their history and on Southern California in the twentieth century. In this process students will carry out original archival research culminating in a significant paper reflecting both their own research discoveries in the archives as well as their new perspectives on American urbanism in Southern California and elsewhere.

HIST 376 Genocide and the Ethical Crisis of Modernity
This course confronts the difficult and profound ethical social and political questions unleashed by the crime of genocide. The idea actuality and experience of genocide in the twentieth century have raised questions about the very nature of society and humanity. By studying the genocidal crises of the modern age from the Armenian Genocide of 1915 to the Holocaust to the contemporary genocide in Darfur in the Sudan we are forced to consider the darkest chapters of modern history and the ethical trauma which follows in their wake. While most students have heard of the Nazi-perpetrated Holocaust which murdered the Jews of Europe the other genocides of the last hundred years are less well known.

This course introduces students to the practice and writing of history through topical approaches. Students will explore methodological approaches to historical inquiry conduct research projects and improve their writing skills.
The Mexican Revolution:
Studies of the Mexican Revolution have been at the forefront in the development of modern Latin American social political and cultural history. The studies have also contributed to comparative discussions in world history about the meanings of revolutionary experience in the twentieth century. However historians and other social scientists have reached no consensus about the Mexican Revolution from its periodization to its actual existence. This seminar will examine the competing set of interpretations alongside primary sources to analyze the origins course and legacy of the Mexican Revolution. Prominent historiographical themes for the course include: conflict between elite liberalism and mass mobilization; agrarian reform and unionization within a capitalist project of development; corporate representation of social interests; the institutionalization of revolution; race gender and class in nationalist rhetoric; and the role of art education and science/technology in state formation. Open to majors and minors only or may enroll with instructor's approval.
Reel History:

Open to majors and minors only or may enroll with instructor's approval.
Writing the History of the Middle East:
This course is a junior seminar on recent developments in the research and writing of history as practiced by professional historians of the modern Middle East. We will look at the history of historical writing about the region and the transformative developments in the field over the last thirty years or so. The objective is to cultivate your awareness of historiography and historical criticism. Historiography can be defined as the history of historical interpretation. Historical criticism refers to how we understand history as an object of study. To appreciate various modes of inquiry in the field we will read exemplary texts embodying established traditions and new departures as well as critical works on the ideological roots of particular fields of history. Open to majors and minors only or may enroll with instructor's approval.
The Fascist Revolution: Politics Culture and Soc:
This History 300/ Junior Seminar closely studies the period known as Fascist Italy (1922 to 1945). Through a close analysis of the politics culture and society of Italy under Fascist dictatorship we study the causes character and ramification of the Italian abandonment of democracy in the wake of World War I. Because it is a History 300 historiographic seminar we examine the central debates of the field such as whether Mussolini ruled primarily through coercion or consent the extent of Fascist race ideology and whether the regime was "modern" or "backward-looking." Other major themes include Fascist cultural modernism gender and Fascism and the Italian road to empire and World War II. This course uses primary sources such as translated documents memoirs and diaries as well as contemporary historical analyses.
Writing World History:
This junior seminar investigates various approaches to writing world history. The course is designed to help history majors understand historiography and historical criticism. By studying recent approaches to world history students will learn how historical debate shapes the writing of history how historians approach and critique each other's work and how different styles of historical research and writing have developed over time. Open to majors and minors only or may enroll with permission of instructor.
Re-Assessing European Global Encounters:
The  20th-century national movements of liberation from modern European colonialism initiated new histories of the previous early modern age of exploration (1300-1800) from the point of view of the enslaved the conquered the exploited and the newly liberated. Each student will be writing a historiographical essay revealing changing interpretations of one distinctive global encounter. Historians are re-assessing on the Mediterranean both the Crusades and piracy and kidnapping. Scholars specializing in trade or colonialism of a particular nation-state such as Portugal Spain Netherlands England and France are re-considering specific settlements and trading ports on the Atlantic and Pacific Rims. Class work will enhance student skills: we shall be discussing exemplary recent historical films and histories and we shall learn how to efficiently find diverse viewpoints through on-line and printed sources.  Prerequisite: Open to majors minors and others with instructor's approval.
Histories of the French and Haitian Revolutions:
Many histories have been and continue to be written about these revolutions and they differ from each other substantially. This course examines this scholarly literature taking into account the choices historians make as they compose their narratives. We will examine the roles of race class and gender in these accounts why different events and social groups are featured centrally in some but not others. And we will consider such controversial criteria as "accuracy" "truth" "evidence" and even "fact" all of which are interpreted in numerous ways within the historian's craft.

LATN 320 Metamorphic Bodies: Fluid Forms from Ovid to Kafka
"To speak of forms changed into new bodies [...] from the very beginning of the world up to my own times." Thus begins Ovid's Metamorphoses, whose programmatic opening stanza links the the birth of the world from formlessness and chaos to a narrative principle of transformation and change over time. This course will explore the shifting conceptions of metamorphosis -- the transformation of "forms [...] into new bodies," and vice versa -- from its mythic origins in Ovid to its modern manifestations and modulations in the works of Goethe, Darwin, and Kafka. Throughout  the course, we will examine the ambiguous relationship between "forms" and "bodies" in Western thought and how the permutations of this nexus come to bear on a wide variety of different topics in the humanities, including myths and theories of changing forms in nature (plants, clouds, animals); dynamic representations of gender, sexuality, and erotics; as well as figures of hybridity and the grotesque (human-animalhybrids, beasts, and monstrosities). More broadly, the course will explore the porous interfaces between ancient and modern poetics, myth and modernity, as well as the arts and sciences.

MAC 246 Topics in Film History
Classical and Post-Classical American Cinema (1930s to 1960s). A survey course on American independent cinema and Hollywood studio productions from the emergence of sound cinema and the fortification of business models and generic conventions in the studio system up through the social, political, and civil rumblings of the early 1960's. Topics include genre theory; gender, race, and class in American cinema and society; independent and experimental counter-cinemas operating outside the Hollywood model; censorship; and the evolution of film genres. The course will draw upon College's location in Los Angeles as a source of research, screening, and programming opportunities.
American Cinema (1970s to the Present). A survey course on American independent cinema and Hollywood studio productions from the late 1970s to the present. Topics include the response of independent and experimental cinemas to Hollywood's hegemony; the cultural significance of American cinema; the global success of American films and their impact upon production, stardom, distribution, and exhibition; the aesthetics of film image, sound, and narration; and the effects of new digital technologies on spectacle, and spectatorship. The course will draw upon College's location in Los Angeles as a source of research, screening, and programming opportunities.
Modernity and the Rise of Cinematic Visuality. Many have argued that the history of modernity has been, above all, a history of visualization, changing the way we see. In this course, we will examine a diverse range of nineteenth and early twentieth century visual practices, technologies, and experiences -- including train rides, panoramas, shopping arcades, assembly lines, and amusement parks -- that helped shape the "modern observer" by altering both the perception and understanding of time and space, public and private, work and leisure, the normal and deviant, and the individual and collective. Through a combination of critical readings, screenings, and field trips, we will ask how such practices of looking not only influenced early cinematic form and content, but also how they continue to inflect postmodern media culture, from television to the internet. The course culminates in a 3D screening of HUGO (2011, Scorsese).

A survey course on the global language of film and media. Screenings and readings will cover a range of national contexts, examining questions of national identity, national cinema, alternative cinema, Third cinema, experimental ethnography, diaspora, postcoloniality, globalization, and transnationality. The course will take advantage of the international and intercultural makeup of Los Angeles as a means of exploring media and accessing practitioners who are working across national boundaries.
Topics in Global Media: African Cinema.  African has one of the largest, if not the largest, film industries in the world. However, it is rarely given much, if any, significance within global film theory and history. This course will explore African film and video across a broad historical period including early colonial visual culture, post-independence Francophone Art films, sub-Saharan Black African cinema, Anglophone Nollywood and Ghana popular video, the visual griot, the Yoruba traveling theatre tradition, and African new media. This class also is a survey of the academic traditions that have attempted to examine the history of African film and media. We will explore such traditions as National Cinema, Third Cinema, Diasporic Cinema, Transnational Cinema, and Experimental Ethnography. Within each of these often-conflicting traditions we will focus in on a particular regional case study. We are faced with several obstacles in this project, including the vexing difficulties of cross-cultural analysis. What if the cinematic practices in Africa and North America are so different that we cannot properly speak of a trans-cultural medium of film in general? Complicating things further is the fact that cinema itself has been crucial in the formation of the concept of race, the nation state, and Africa.

This hybrid media theory and practice course directly engages the interrelationship between discursive and creative production. Classes will include screenings, lectures, discussion, and hands-on experiences in producing and collaborating on digital media projects.
Remix Media and Culture Jamming.
What is Remix Media? Remixing, reusing, and reworking separate media elements from different sources to produce an entirely new work with a different meaning. What is Culture Jamming? A term popularized by cultural critic and 1982 College alumnus Mark Dery for creative practices that "jam the signal" or subvert the products of dominant media culture. This theory/practice course takes a critical look at the history of remix culture -- from Dada to Machinima -- along with the gamut of aesthetic, political, and social concerns addressed by remix artists and musicians and the reception (and even appropriation) of their work by the corporate entertainment industry. Students will put theory into practice by producing their own remix projects including a subvertisement series and remix video. We will also explore issues around copyright and fair use in the sampling of both commercial and independently-produced works.

MAC 295 Topics in Film and Media Studies
The study of film and media has involved disciplinary and interdisciplinary approaches for about half a century. This intermediate topical course of varying emphases studies the key critical terms, issues, and debates in popular media cultural study, including genre study, in relation to specific topics. Readings of film and media examples illustrate how different theories or perspectives can be applied to contemporary pop culture.
Genre in Contemporary Film, TV, and Digital Media.  Genre films were part of Classic Hollywood, but genres started changing in interesting ways as media industries evolved after World War II, with the introduction of television, new technologies that enabled shooting on location or new opportunities with color film, the rise of drive-in movie theaters and indie or exploitation filmmaking. We will study the shift from classic genre films and theory to hybrid genres and genre revisionism in film/media movements spearheaded by people of color, feminists, and LGBT communities as well as studios. The focus in the class is on genre theory studied through historical and technological shifts in media production. Screenings will introduce a range of genres, from classic films like the Western and noir to more recent genres like road films, television melodramas and war video games.
Imagining War: Genre on Screen and Battlefield. The war film has arguably been one of the most consistent and popular elements of cinema's history. It was a component of film from its beginnings and is now a regular mainstay amongst Hollywood blockbusters. It has also undergone several political revisions and technological shifts in media production, distribution and exhibition, making it ideally suited to study the theory and history of genre. Importantly, this course will not only look at how war figures in film, but how film also profoundly effects and configures war. Entertainment andwar are the United States' primary exports. Militarism and the Hollywood studio system have had a long and deadly interdependence. By conceiving of the viewing screen as an extension of the battlefield (and vice versa), this course will look at the profound social and political implications of the classic genre system. We will do this by examining such films as Apocalypse Now, The Deer Hunter, Hiroshima Mon Amour, Battle of Algiers, Black Hawk Down, Kandahar, Night and Fog, The Hurt Locker. Das Boot, Saving Private Ryan, All Quiet on the Western Front, Dr. Strangelove, Inglourious Basterds, Birth of a Nation, Rambo, MASH, as well as a host of television shows, Websites, and video games
The Western: From Colonialism to Gaming. This course will primarily explore the classic Hollywood genre system through a detailed look at ‘The Western.’ However, before looking at how genre operates within cinema, we take a broad historical and theoretical examination of genre within literary studies, critical theory, Wild West shows, philosophy, travel literature, ethnographic photography, and cultural studies. The aim is to critically examine a wide array of generic conventions within The Western film, while simultaneously situating these conventions within the broader historical and ideological context of European colonization of North America. Particular attention will be placed on the role of racial and gender performances within The Western genre as both a founding American myth and a component of the Hollywood film system. We will analyze both the classic Western as well as revisionist films. Additionally, we will investigate how the genre transforms as it moves into other media, including fine art, television, gaming, and other digital contexts.

MUSC 261 Western Music and Culture: 1600-1789
This course surveys the two centuries that gave rise to European art music's most enduring legacies: opera instrumental art music and especially the major-minor tonal system which as the system that informs most music today is arguably Europe's greatest-ever cultural export. The emergence of this tonal system will enable instrumental music to sustain a listener's attention through dramatic forms and without the aid of words; comprehending how these forms behave will be one of our central tasks. In turn the cultivation of instrumental genres will fuel the operatic accomplishments of Classical composers notably Mozart. Our study of vocal and instrumental music will proceed chronologically and focus on individual cities starting with Florence and ending with Vienna. With the only prerequisite in taking this course being the ability to read musical notation students from other disciplines who are eager for music-intensive study are especially welcome. Music majors and minors taking the course will be given assignments tailored to their knowledge and departmental expectations. Freshmen may not enroll in this course.

MUSC 268 Vienna, 1890-1914
This multidisciplinary course takes the crucible that was fin-de-siècle Vienna as its object of study beginning with the city’s 1890-92 expansion to include the suburbs south of the Danube to the beginning of World War I which brought an end to the Hapsburg dynasty and Austria-Hungary. Our approach to studying Vienna will be prismatic: each week will consist of one seminar on its music (principally the music of Gustav Mahler and Arnold Schoenberg) and one guest lecture on one of the following aspects of the city at this time: urban planning economics political history architecture art dance psychology medicine science and religion. The last three weeks on campus will be devoted to German language instruction and individual research projects. The on-campus component of the course will culminate in transforming Bird Studio into a Viennese coffee house which will welcome the campus community and during which students must impersonate through knowledgeable conversation a contemporaneous Viennese figure central to their field of research. This immersive on-campus study will crescendo to the downbeat of the course: the week after Commencement you will board a flight for Vienna for three weeks of intensive study there convening as a class each day attending lectures classes (including a cooking class!) and concerts and visiting the historical cultural and musical sites we studied on campus. We will take three three-hour guided walking tours of architectural monuments of historical (including music-historical) monuments and of Viennese coffee houses. Arriving during the cultural festival Vienna Festival Weeks we will attend as many of its offerings as time permits. Students must apply and participate in an interview for this course whose enrollment will be limited to sixteen students. Frosh may not apply for this course.

MUSC 285 Topics in the Critical Study of Music
Since its emergence in the late 1970s the music video has become the dominant means of advertising popular music and musicians as well as one of the most influential multimedia genres in history.  Music videos have affected aesthetic style in a wide range of film and television genres introducing experimental and avant-garde techniques to a mass audience.  Because most music videos last only a few minutes it is difficult to make sense of their often-conflicting images sounds and messages.  This course challenges participants to read music videos as texts by engaging with their visual and auditory materials.  We will explore how the gender race and class of video participants shapes meaning as well as how pacing and editing contribute to (or detract from) a narrative flow. We will also consider the music video in relation to notions of stardom and celebrity and will speculate on the future of the music video amid drastic changes in the production and marketing of media. The second portion of the course applies these analytical skills to a wide variety of media including video games live concert films film and television music placements television title sequences and end credits user generated content YouTube remixes and more.

MUSC 350 Music Analysis: Form, Genre, Point of View
This course approaches musical form and genre from a stylistic point of view. Intense focus on details at both the surface and background levels of musical activity -- melodic, harmonic, rhythmic, and sonic (texture, density, articulation, dynamics, timbre) -- will yield a broad understanding of the ways in which all aspects of musical language influence musical form and style. Readings will reinforce the connection between culture and style, yielding discussion of issues around links between intellectual history and musical genre. For example, why did the fugue evolve and flourish during the Enlightenment and the Scientific Revolution? What happened to opera's da capo aria after the 18th century, and why? Repertoire will be chosen in conjunction with students, and may include works from the Renaissance to the 21st century. The final project will be an analytic paper and a classroom presentation based on this work.

Semantic paradoxes such as the liar paradox and the paradoxes of vagueness reveal problems with everyday concepts such as truth and implication. Supertasks reveal problems with our understanding of infinity. What to say about these problems what they show us about how to understand space time infinity truth and implication for example are some of the issues we will discuss in this class.

PHIL 333 Transitional Justice
When we discuss study and call for 'justice' we often do so in the context of (more or less) stable political institutions. In the contemporary global community we frequently face unstable or non-existent political institutions of the kind assumed in a great deal of our political theory. These transitional contexts often exist in the aftermath of large-scale human rights abuses (such as genocide apartheid and other crimes against humanity). This raises an important question: what constitutes justice in these transitional contexts? This course explores this foundational question through more particular topics such as: the nature and value of truth and reconciliation commissions reparations restorative justice the normative foundations of international criminal law and the nature of evil and atrocity.

PHIL 380 Wittgenstein
Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889-1951) is a central figure in the two most important philosophical traditions of the twentieth century: First the attempt early in the century to characterize language thought and the world in terms of the newly available formalism of modern logic and second the attempt to show that any such formalization will fail to do justice to the rich complexity of language as a form of life a form inseparable from the social and historical context from which it springs.

POLS 201 Work and Labor in America
Sooner or later we all have to work-that is get a job. Some people even have "careers." And some people are lucky enough to consider the work they do a "vocation" - something that is both intrinsically rewarding and useful to society. Work occupies our best waking hours. For most people the nature of our work determines the quality of our daily lives. This course will focus on the varieties of work (in different industries and occupations); how people experience their work on the job; how society shapes the work we do; how work shapes our family lives our friendships our health and our self-esteem; and how the nature of work is changing in our increasingly global economy dominated by large corporations and sophisticated technology. We will look at the future of work in the context of our changing economy values and technologies. We will pay particular attention to how organized groups - labor unions consumer groups business associations and others have influenced the nature of work. We will also explore how government action (public policy) has shaped how our economy works and the rules governing the work we do. These include such matters as wages hours flex time family leave job security workplace health and safety the quality of goods and services and workplace participation. We will explore such questions as: What makes work satisfying or unsatisfying? How have such ideas as "professional" "career" "working class" "middle class" and "job security" changed? Why do we have increasing problems of low-wage work and even "sweatshops" in a wealthy society? How do such factors as education skill race and gender influence the kinds of work we do and how we experience our work? What are the chances of getting injured or sick because of working in a specific job? How do people balance work/career and family responsibilities? Do people experience work the same way in other democratic countries? What can be done to make the world of work better?

POLS 258 Theoretical Accounts of Racism
Is “racism” the appropriate concept to describe our contemporary racial problems? Many scholars have rejected the idea that the persistence of a number of racial ills – like racial inequality, racial discrimination and racial segregation – in the contemporary moment is evidence that racism also persists as a problem in the twenty-first century. “Racism,” these scholars argue, more accurately describes the Jim Crow South and the people in that era who consciously held explicit beliefs about white superiority over all other races. Though acknowledging changes in racial climate and the terrain of acceptable speech with regards to race, other scholars think that unequal racial outcomes, institutional practices and ideological beliefs connect our contemporary racial problems to racial problems that occurred in the 1960s and earlier. This course is an introduction to the scholarship on racism and has as a central aim to get us to judge together whether “racism” is the appropriate concept to describe and provide a frame through which to understand our contemporary problems concerning race. If it is, which accounts of racism are the most compelling to shed light on our current racial circumstances? What about these accounts are particularly pertinent? What can’t the accounts of racism addressed in class explain? If racism is not the right concept to capture our current struggles with race (or all aspects of it), what concepts if any do a better job and why? To facilitate a critical interrogation of the concept racism, this course will cover sociological, historical, social psychological, philosophical and political accounts of racism and related concepts like racial injustice, racial prejudice, race relations, and racial inequality.

RELS 285 Religious Atheism
"We have killed God," Nietzsche explained. But the "Death of God" has not meant, and does not mean, the end of religion. If 'religion' and 'theism' are not the same thing, if human religious concerns and instincts go beyond a belief in God or gods, then what is religion? What is religion without God? This course will examine and compare two versions of 'religious atheism' -- the Buddhist tradition and the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche. In the Buddhist tradition, we find a religious tradition that began without even addressing the question of God or gods and that has continued to develop a non-theistic spirituality for over two millennia. In juxtaposition to that tradition, we interpret Nietzsche's philosophy, which rises out of the ashes of the "Death of God," as a radical revolution in Western spiritual understanding and explore its implications in relation to Buddhism.

This course will provide students the opportunity to study many of the texts that were not included in the Christian canon: the so-called apocrypha."  We will investigate the process by which the Christian canon was formed how and why some texts that were beloved by many ordinary Christians were excluded from the canon by church officials and how the ideological and theological positions found in the rejected texts give us a lens into some of the most heated debates in early Christian communities.  In addition to surveying apocryphal texts and their early Christian contexts the major assignment of the course will be to collaborate with Prof. Upson-Saia on her current research project: a study of how ideas found in the New Testament Apocrypha persist in Catholic tradition-specifically in Catholic doctrine art and liturgy-even though the texts themselves were excluded from the Christian Bible."

Questions about death dying and the afterlife plagued ancient cultures-Greeks Romans Jews and Christians. They asked: How does one live a life free of fear and anxiety over one's inevitable and impending death? How can one die with dignity-whether violently or peacefully whether of one's own volition or at the hands of other humans or God? How should the community structure rituals of death and what should be done with corpses? And how-if at all-will individuals live on in an afterlife? The central goal of this course is to familiarize students with the diversity of notions about death dying and afterlife in ancient cultures by analyzing literature (philosophical medical and poetic) rituals and monuments of the ancient Mediterranean world. We will then contextualize these ideas noting how and why they developed from driving concerns and circumstances of particular communities cultures and historical moments.

This course will allow students to explore those questions as they work alongside Los Angeles Times architecture critic Christopher Hawthorne in helping research and write a new architectural guidebook for Southern California. A new approach to compiling a guidebook will offer the chance to move beyond a limited list of pedigreed architectural landmarks and think about L.A.'s vernacular architecture as well as the way that new investments in transit and public space and waves of immigration have changed the city's built form over the last several decades.

WRD 265 Feminist Rhetoric and Social Change

This class positions the study of feminist rhetorics within the larger study of language and discourse theories as we examine how social relations power knowledge and identities are constituted through private and public rhetorical acts. Through our readings we will engage a wide range of contributions to a rhetorical critical history by women who either as practitioners or theorists advanced their visions of social change and acted to implement them. Course readings will begin in antiquity to provide a foundation for our study though much of our material will focus on texts from the nineteenth-century to the present to examine the intersections of gender and rhetoric.

        <h1>Pattern-Matching Chatbot Assignment</h1>
        <p><strong>For beginners:</strong></p>
        <p>This <a href="https://ccsc-sw-2019-apps.herokuapp.com/chatbot/">chatbot webapp</a> is initially meant to simulate a psychotherapist. Try to have a conversation with it - where does the conversation break down?</p>
        <p>On the left side of the app, you can see the rules that the chatbot is using. See if you can get particular responses from the chatbot. You can also change the rules - you won't break the app. If you're feeling ambitious, see if you can get the chatbot to respond appropriately to "My name is Justin".</p>
        <p><strong>For advanced students:</strong></p>
        <p>Using the <a href="https://ccsc-sw-2019-apps.herokuapp.com/chatbot/">chatbot webapp</a>, create a chatbot that would serve as a "front desk" for Oxy - ie. who would be approached by someone new to campus. You will not be able to change the first line of the chatbot, so pretend it says "Welcome to Oxy, how can I help you?".</p>
